1
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,605
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,500
(Episode 4)

3
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,619
You applied for the
National Health Fund.

4
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,479
But now, you're building buildings
for R&D of decoction pieces.

5
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:45,440
And, you're just building them
without any of the R&D.

6
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,919
It doesn't fit the description
of projects that we support.

7
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,560
Sir,

8
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,720
I've told you before.

9
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,800
This is the incubation centre
of TCM herbs.

10
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,000
It's just a tiny part
of our industrial park.

11
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,759
Sir, look at the opposite building.

12
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:01,119
We're preparing to bring in

13
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,599
a first-class
physical examination centre,

14
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:04,640
which is a listed company too.

15
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,560
The Grade A tertiary hospitals
will move here within five years.

16
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,440
The preventative treatments
and recovery processes

17
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,879
will be done in our centre

18
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,359
after the Grade A tertiary hospitals.

19
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,841
Sir,

20
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,799
this is our plan for national health.

21
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,724
Mr Liu,

22
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:21,519
you're talking about five years
from now, or even ten years from now.

23
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:24,080
Everyone can achieve something
after getting an investment.

24
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,319
However, we only have
so much money right now

25
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:28,359
and we have to invest in someone
whose business is already established.

26
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:32,440
This is just an empty
industrial factory.

27
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,199
Where is your sincerity?

28
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,300
Chief Secretary,

29
00:02:38,543 --> 00:02:39,399
Director,

30
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:41,640
do you guys know

31
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,799
Ren Xin Zheng?

32
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,465
Professor Ren of the University of TCM?

33
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,360
That's right.

34
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,280
Of course I know him.

35
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:49,240
My father always went to him

36
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,280
whenever he was sick.

37
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,560
Professor Ren

38
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,079
is just like the banner
of Jiangzhou City.

39
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,199
He's well-known throughout the country.

40
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,399
That's right.

41
00:02:59,079 --> 00:02:59,920
Professor Ren

42
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:03,079
is the biggest sincerity we can show.

43
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,680
In the healthcare industry,

44
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:10,640
nurturing talent is a main element.

45
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,600
To nurture talents,
we must have good education.

46
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,880
Both of you should know this.

47
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,719
As long as Professor Ren is here,

48
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:20,320
he has a set of complete
education blueprint.

49
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,839
Once he opens his academy,

50
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,360
and he pumps out those talents,

51
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,439
the healthcare industry park

52
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,479
will have nothing to worry about.

53
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,960
Is he here?

54
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,047
That's right.

55
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,439
He already resigned from his post.

56
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,199
He's here to support my business.

57
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,000
He and his students

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,600
are living on my property right now.

59
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,640
I guess I found him by chance, huh?

60
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,159
My father

61
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,159
was just complaining that Professor Ren

62
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,719
had stopped giving people diagnoses.

63
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,559
His nameplate was also removed from

64
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:50,639
the TCM affiliated hospital's
Department of Internal Medicine.

65
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,240
I didn't expect

66
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,559
to find him here.

67
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,737
Let's go.

68
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:56,359
Let's visit Professor Ren.

69
00:03:56,359 --> 00:03:57,200
Please.

70
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,200
I'm afraid this will be a busy place

71
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,439
in the future.

72
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,784
Professor Ren.

73
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,320
Look who's here.

74
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:26,175
Professor Ren.

75
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,639
Congratulations on the opening
of your apprentice class.

76
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,320
Thank you.

77
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,159
Professor Ren,

78
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,439
do you still remember me?

79
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,559
I can't remember faces well.

80
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,040
I'm sure you remember my father then.

81
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:42,480
It's Mr Cao, who always
had tinnitus issues.

82
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:43,719
Cao Fang Hua.

83
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,919
You cured his tinnitus.

84
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,200
I accompanied my father to see you
several times.

85
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:50,400
I see.

86
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,559
You see,

87
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,200
I had examined too many patients.

88
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,320
That's why I...

89
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,439
I understand.

90
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,799
Among the projects

91
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,040
that the government will support,

92
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,600
they'll allocate a significant portion

93
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,159
for education purposes.

94
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:05,880
Professor Ren, you can apply
for government subsidy

95
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,760
for the apprentice class you're holding.

96
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:08,968
That's right.

97
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,600
That's why we invited Director Xia

98
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,760
and Chief Secretary Cao
from the National Health Fund.

99
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,120
Let's see if there's a way for us
to cooperate.

100
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,200
I've already applied for it.

101
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,488
But it wasn't approved.

102
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,960
That's why I'm doing it right now.

103
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,880
You're highly revered.

104
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,760
They'll surely approve it.

105
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,585
Yes.

106
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,719
Professor Ren, can you tell us
about the planning

107
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:30,887
for your apprentice class?

108
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:32,600
There's no planning.

109
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,480
I'm taking it one step at a time.

110
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,600
The passing down of TCM culture
halted for many years.

111
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,079
That's why I'm figuring things out
as I go.

112
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,159
I'm taking it one step at a time.

113
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:45,639
Professor Ren's biggest flaw is modesty.

114
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,559
He has been in the TCM field
his entire life.

115
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,799
He educates people and
provides diagnosis.

116
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,439
That's why he already has
a well-thought-out strategy.

117
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:52,360
That's not it.

118
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,169
Not at all.

119
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,520
It will never work without

120
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,800
the help of superiors like you two.

121
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:57,760
What about this?

122
00:05:57,999 --> 00:05:59,640
There's no time like the present.

123
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,600
Let's request the professor
to read our pulse.

124
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,880
-Sure.
-Sure.

125
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,880
Not today.

126
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,640
I have a class to teach.

127
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,399
You guys can come again

128
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,760
when I'm not teaching.

129
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,999
We might not have time next time.

130
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,880
If you have needs,

131
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,959
you'll make time for it.

132
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,620
This is...

133
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,760
If so,

134
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,239
we should not trouble him.

135
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,279
I'm sure you two are perfectly healthy.

136
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,439
Just read our pulse for fun.

137
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,640
For fun, okay? Come on.

138
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,880
I won't see you guys off then.

139
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,839
You guys are welcome

140
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,880
to attend my lesson.

141
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,559
Maybe you can put
what you learned to use in the future.

142
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,999
What lesson will you be teaching today?

143
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,959
Cerebral infarction, heart attack,
epilepsy,

144
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,760
Yang depletion syndrome, and so on.

145
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,239
I'll talk about TCM first-aid
for such situations.

146
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,760
Before we talk about TCM first-aid,

147
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,999
I would like to ask you guys this.

148
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,439
What are the "eyes"
for TCM practitioners?

149
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:55,400
Anyone?

150
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,697
Yin and Yang.

151
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,719
That's right.

152
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,200
Yin and Yang.

153
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,320
So, how can we differentiate
between Yin and Yang?

154
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,839
Oh no, we're studying metaphysics again.

155
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,812
This is not metaphysics.

156
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,480
It's easy to identify them.

157
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,200
Before we learned how to stand and walk,

158
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,320
we had to crawl.

159
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:23,920
The area where your back faces
the sunlight is known as Yang.

160
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,239
Yin is the area
where it faces the ground.

161
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,080
There are three Yangs and three Yins
in the human body.

162
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,080
Tai Yang, Shao Yang, and Yang Ming.

163
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,480
Tai Yin, Jue Yin, and Shao Yin.

164
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,800
They have
an interconnected relationship.

165
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,399
So, what does the term
"interconnected" mean?

166
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:41,920
Outsiders will be confused

167
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:43,800
when they hear the term.

168
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,320
Actually,

169
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,360
it's very simple.

170
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:48,576
Guys, take a look.

171
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,760
This is the surface.

172
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,999
On the other side,

173
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,121
this is the interior.

174
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,040
Yang Ming Meridian is on the surface.

175
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,760
Tai Yin Meridian is inside.

176
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,200
Shao Yang Meridian is on the surface.

177
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,200
On the contrary,
Jue Yin Meridian is inside.

178
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,839
Tai Yang Meridian is on the surface.

179
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,559
Shao Yin Meridian

180
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,825
is inside.

181
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,839
It's very convenient to know this.

182
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,320
Understood?

183
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,112
Tou Tou.

184
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,881
Tou Tou!

185
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:29,999
Is it lunchtime?

186
00:08:32,319 --> 00:08:33,158
It's not lunchtime.

187
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:35,080
It's not time yet.

188
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,200
Guys, stop laughing.

189
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,880
Tou Tou's able to sit here

190
00:08:40,838 --> 00:08:41,838
and focus so deeply

191
00:08:42,199 --> 00:08:44,520
that she fell asleep.

192
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:47,760
The Chinese language

193
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:50,360
is deep and complex.

194
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:53,559
There are two parts to the human body.

195
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,200
First, it's "Xing", which means shape.

196
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,760
Second, it's "Shen",
which means spirit or focus.

197
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,880
I realised something.

198
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,559
Although some of you
are in this classroom,

199
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:06,800
your focus isn't here.

200
00:09:07,439 --> 00:09:09,080
You're scrolling your phone instead.

201
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:11,239
I think Tou Tou is better than you.

202
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:13,320
At least Tou Tou's so focused

203
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,399
that she fell asleep.

204
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,480
I truly hope you guys

205
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,520
can cherish our class.

206
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,679
If you don't feel like listening,
you can sleep.

207
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,119
Sleeping leads to revitalization.

208
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:26,959
Revitalization

209
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,640
leads to enlightenment,

210
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,600
and enlightenment leads to awakening.

211
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,320
I think sleeping is better
than scrolling one's phone.

212
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,640
Maybe

213
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:39,679
an enlightened one will
be born in our class

214
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,999
after sleeping.

215
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,584
Go ahead.

216
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,360
I need to head to the toilet.

217
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:58,839
Go ahead.

218
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,123
(Passing down of TCM)

219
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,239
Why aren't they back yet?

220
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,559
Do you know how long I've been waiting?

221
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,439
Aren't you guys hungry?

222
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,584
Handsome,

223
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:39,760
stop pulling a long face.

224
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,119
It's bad for your health

225
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,640
if you keep sulking like this.

226
00:10:43,239 --> 00:10:44,127
Don't you think so?

227
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,880
Don't act like your father.

228
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,968
Let me ask you something.

229
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,640
Say, will your father make kids cry

230
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,999
when he gives them a diagnosis?

231
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:51,840
I'm sure he will.

232
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,439
Your mother must've
had it rough if she has

233
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:54,320
to spend time with him all day long.

234
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,760
I knew there was food!

235
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,760
Calm down.

236
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,055
Tou Tou,

237
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,119
it's difficult to order food for you.

238
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,640
You'll complain about the ingredients,

239
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,640
the cook,

240
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,559
the taste, and the freshness...

241
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:14,200
Enough already.

242
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,080
Listen. I've made at least
1,000 food deliveries

243
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,280
by now.

244
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,175
I'm not bragging here.

245
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,160
I can tell which restaurants
these orders are from

246
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:21,640
by just taking a sniff.

247
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,760
The ones I told you to avoid

248
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:25,039
are not that good.

249
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:25,967
Understood?

250
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:29,320
Words alone are no proof.

251
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,200
Besides the restaurants

252
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,080
you acknowledged,

253
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,080
we've also ordered food from
several restaurants nearby

254
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,976
with the best rating.

255
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,255
Try them out.

256
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,320
If you think they're okay,

257
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,119
we can order them

258
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:39,400
without any issues in the future.

259
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,320
Try them?

260
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,160
Does that mean I can try all of them?

261
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,096
Of course.

262
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,215
(Sun Tou Tou's Taste Test)

263
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
I'm ready.

264
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,080
Let's begin.

265
00:12:01,439 --> 00:12:02,320
Use the serving chopsticks.

266
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,760
The others can't have the rest

267
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,880
if you try them with
your own chopsticks.

268
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,080
You're so annoying.

269
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,640
Why don't you serve me instead?

270
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,599
This must be from Shudaonan.

271
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,280
They mainly serve Sichuan cuisine.

272
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,880
However, in order to accommodate
the taste of Jiangzhou,

273
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,080
it's not sweet or spicy enough.

274
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,919
Don't order from them.

275
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:24,880
Their quality has deteriorated.

276
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,919
Come. Try the next one.

277
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:29,720
You don't need to open it.

278
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,960
I could tell which restaurant
it was from

279
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,760
when you brought it in.

280
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,080
This is my favourite restaurant.

281
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:35,320
Nongjia Cuisine's
Large Intestines with Stinky Tofu.

282
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,193
Look.

283
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,200
They added broad beans and peppercorns.
It smells heavenly!

284
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,760
I was wondering who ordered it.
I knew it was you.

285
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,039
Everyone can smell it from
three miles away.

286
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:42,880
Next one.

287
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,080
-Is this mine?
-This one.

288
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:49,479
Peng Shi Yan, you're something else.

289
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,640
This is from Xiaochun Japanese Cuisine.

290
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,119
You actually ordered
such expensive food?

291
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,200
Can we afford to have this every day?

292
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,880
You can tell just from
trying their egg roll?

293
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,439
I don't think you're
a food delivery rider.

294
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:00,320
Give me another piece.

295
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,520
You're more like
a Michelin guide inspector.

296
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,640
Next one.

297
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,559
Can you tell or not?

298
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,760
Wait. This tastes strange.

299
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:27,439
Sauteed alfalfa with rice liquor.

300
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,320
They used a mixture of Erguotou
and rice liquor.

301
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,300
It can only be from the Ginkgo
Restaurant at the junction.

302
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,175
Am I right?

303
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,034
However, this dish is...

304
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,119
Both the heat control and texture
are different.

305
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,280
Did they make this?

306
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:37,960
Tou Tou,

307
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:39,840
you're truly impressive.

308
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:41,799
They did change their cook.

309
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,880
The chubby cook went
to open his own stall.

310
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,320
The current cook is his student.

311
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,760
I know! It's that skinny guy.

312
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,999
He doesn't control the heat well.

313
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,049
Wait.

314
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,320
How could you afford to order food

315
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,520
from a fancy restaurant
like Ginkgo Restaurant?

316
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:00,559
The lunch box had a hole in it

317
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,740
when the food delivery rider
delivered the food to us last time.

318
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,080
I said it was the work of that rider.

319
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,999
You guys didn't believe me.

320
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:09,239
Do all food delivery riders
have the same habit?

321
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,999
Peng Shi Yan, are you out of your mind?

322
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,080
What do you mean by that?

323
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,160
Are you looking down on
food delivery riders?

324
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,439
That's not it.

325
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,359
Listen.

326
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,799
So what if you're a paediatrician?

327
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:25,840
Do you think you earn a lot of money

328
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,880
compared to me?

329
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,160
Be careful! Don't slip and fall.

330
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:28,980
Come here!

331
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:30,320
Do you think you earn a lot?

332
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,791
I'm making much more money than you!

333
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,620
That was heartbreaking.

334
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,100
You shouldn't expose other people's
shortcomings when you curse them.

335
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,112
Tou Tou,

336
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:38,080
did you learn all of these
when you were a food delivery rider?

337
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,960
I had to deliver food every day.

338
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,119
I had no time to learn.

339
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,768
Tou,

340
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,239
I'm impressed.

341
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,520
In the future, I'll listen to you
when it comes to food delivery.

342
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,559
Who ordered this?

343
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,479
Why isn't anyone taking it?

344
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,273
Son.

345
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:09,640
-Mum.
-Niece-in-law,

346
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,400
you're pretty particular.

347
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,320
Illness finds its way in by the mouth.

348
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,559
Trouble issues from the mouth too.

349
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:16,320
If you control your mouth,

350
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,960
you can survive longer.

351
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,280
Was your mother insulting me just now?

352
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,439
Do you know how disposable dishware

353
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:48,760
is made?

354
00:15:50,439 --> 00:15:51,999
Do you know all disposable dishware

355
00:15:51,999 --> 00:15:53,640
is bleached with hydrogen peroxide?

356
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,559
Do you know the disposable dishware
you're using

357
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:57,599
might be expired

358
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:59,960
and might contain E.coli
and hepatitis virus?

359
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,880
There's mold on your chopsticks.

360
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,479
And, you've swallowed it.

361
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,559
Enough. Stop talking, alright?

362
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,880
Your mother said so herself.

363
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,880
Trouble issues from the mouth.

364
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,799
I can survive for two more years
if you just keep it to yourself.

365
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,239
She behaves like a hooligan.

366
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:25,039
Let's not bring them here tomorrow.

367
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:26,439
We should be like them.

368
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,840
It's unhygienic, you know?

369
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,119
Pathogenic factors cannot invade the
body with enough healthy qi inside.

370
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,840
I can tell

371
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:38,080
that you're a prince at home.

372
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,559
You've never endured any hardships.

373
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:41,160
You even eat like a prince.

374
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:43,599
You'll starve to death
if you eat like that.

375
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,559
You have to eat quickly.

376
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:46,999
Only then, you'll get full.

377
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,679
I can share your food with you

378
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:52,760
if you can't finish it.

379
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:07,359
Look at how she eats.

380
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:15,671
Tou Tou,

381
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:17,520
are you not full yet?

382
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,320
Look, I separated them.

383
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,359
If you don't mind,

384
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:22,558
you can have my share.

385
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:26,942
I'm coming!

386
00:17:31,282 --> 00:17:32,094
Thank you, my nephew.

387
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,160
In ancient times, there was
an ancient beast called Taotie.

388
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,119
Its mouth was larger than its gills.

389
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,479
It could swallow everything in one bite.

390
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,660
In the past, I used to think
that it was a male beast,

391
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,520
until I encountered Tou Tou.

392
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,400
Do you know that all villains die
from talking too much?

393
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:48,949
Guys,

394
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:51,439
I've helped you guys
to test all the food today.

395
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:53,760
I think the best is
Xiaochun Japanese Cuisine.

396
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,400
I have no issues having them

397
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,119
every day.

398
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,840
-What do you guys think?
-You're too broke for that.

399
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:00,932
Wait, you...

400
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,080
Why must you act like this?

401
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:03,439
You say you have no money
when we're having nice food.

402
00:18:03,439 --> 00:18:04,880
You say the ingredients aren't fresh
when we order cheap food.

403
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,439
What? You want everyone to starve?

404
00:18:06,479 --> 00:18:08,119
Let's choose the most
cost-effective one.

405
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,840
Luckily, they didn't use
gutter oil in their cooking.

406
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:12,599
I'm fine with
the inferior food ingredients.

407
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:13,479
I agree.

408
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,280
All take-out food is the same nowadays.

409
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,880
It's not like you can go into
their kitchen and instruct them.

410
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,960
I'm fine as long as
it can fill my tummy.

411
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,439
This place is too remote.

412
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:21,080
We're lucky that we can order
food delivery here.

413
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,320
We should be grateful that
we have food to eat.

414
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,479
This won't do!

415
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:26,599
Why are we spending money on it
when we know that it isn't good?

416
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:27,559
Doesn't that mean we're supporting

417
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:28,999
a shoddy food trend here?

418
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,432
We must never compromise!

419
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:31,479
Nice!

420
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:33,391
Hero Peng.

421
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:35,559
You're Hero Peng to me.

422
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,140
Why don't we let
Peng Shi Yan be our class monitor?

423
00:18:39,239 --> 00:18:40,097
Are you guys okay with that?

424
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:41,119
-Sure!
-Is that okay?

425
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,680
Don't do that! Wait!

426
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:43,640
Aren't we having lunch?

427
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,359
Why am I the class monitor now?

428
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,239
Let's talk about the food.

429
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:47,640
Talk about the food?

430
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:51,239
What about this?

431
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:54,319
I'll cook for you guys in the future,

432
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:55,766
okay?

433
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:57,839
Can you even cook?

434
00:18:58,199 --> 00:18:59,760
Of course.

435
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,640
I would've been a head chef by now

436
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,040
if my nephew didn't want me

437
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:04,359
to be his stupid successor.

438
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:07,119
I'm serious.

439
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:08,201
Okay then.

440
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,520
Tou Tou will be in charge of our food

441
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:12,040
tomorrow.

442
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:13,123
What do you think?

443
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,880
I want to order something.

444
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:18,839
I want Shredded Pork with Garlic Sauce.

445
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:19,895
Sure.

446
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:20,880
Shredded Pork with Garlic Sauce.

447
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,079
-Okay.
-Tou Tou.

448
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:25,160
Can I order Braised Beef?

449
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,239
Sure.

450
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,880
Class monitor, take out
your pen and paper.

451
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,999
Tell him to jot down
what you want tomorrow.

452
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,999
What would you like to order?

453
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,599
Braised Fresh Abalone with Fish Maw.

454
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,880
Braised Fresh Abalone...

455
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:41,959
What the heck is that?

456
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:48,640
Be careful not to hurt
my ginseng seedling.

457
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:53,119
Mr Ren.

458
00:19:53,479 --> 00:19:54,479
I mean, Professor Ren.

459
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:55,560
It's been so many years.

460
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,560
Have I ever spoiled your things before?

461
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:03,319
I would be just like Sun Tou Tou
if I couldn't even differentiate between

462
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,959
ginseng seedlings and weeds.

463
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,119
Be careful.

464
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,119
Why don't you do it yourself?

465
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,839
I know.

466
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,560
You're taking a detour
to insult Sun Tou Tou.

467
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:23,719
I didn't take a detour.

468
00:20:23,719 --> 00:20:25,079
I'm insulting her directly.

469
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,119
Sun Tou Tou

470
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:35,719
is different from us.

471
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:38,599
She doesn't come from
a good family background like you.

472
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:41,199
She's not as cultivated as us.

473
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:42,920
No one taught her

474
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:44,479
about courtesy

475
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:45,839
or elegance.

476
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:46,800
All of these

477
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:49,599
should be provided during
the family education phase.

478
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:54,829
But now,

479
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:57,119
it's our task to educate her.

480
00:20:59,321 --> 00:21:00,326
You see,

481
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:03,079
she has a sharp sense

482
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,599
of taste and smell.

483
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:06,560
I think she can

484
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,680
be a TCM practitioner.

485
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:11,560
That's just on you.

486
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:15,239
You should be more patient

487
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:16,560
toward Sun Tou Tou.

488
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:21,239
It's not like I'm not patient with her.

489
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:24,440
I don't know her at all.

490
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:27,119
Wu Shan Dao

491
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,999
just brought her here

492
00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:30,359
and left her to us.

493
00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:32,079
And, she's our senior too.

494
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:34,599
I've never met a person like her before.

495
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:36,440
How could I acknowledge
someone like that?

496
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:39,880
You must believe in
the power of education.

497
00:21:40,479 --> 00:21:41,599
This is just the beginning.

498
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:42,760
We still have a long way to go.

499
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,359
If, one day,

500
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:45,839
she couldn't be our successor

501
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:46,959
or a TCM practitioner,

502
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:49,280
at least she could become

503
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:52,319
a well-educated lady.

504
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:54,599
We're helping society

505
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:59,479
to nurture an educated
and well-mannered lady.

506
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:00,959
This is merit too, am I right?

507
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:02,999
Well-mannered lady, huh?

508
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:04,280
Who do you think

509
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,839
will marry a girl like her?

510
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,640
You're spouting nonsense again.

511
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:10,239
The Qingming Festival is nearing.

512
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,280
Remember to prepare her dress for her.

513
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,719
I was just saying.

514
00:22:14,719 --> 00:22:16,839
I'll still do my part without fail.

515
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:18,599
I've already told Peng Shi Yan

516
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:20,239
to take their measurements.

517
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:23,199
Speaking of which,

518
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:24,880
I have to discuss something with you.

519
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:26,959
We have so many people here.

520
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:29,119
We have to spend money
for our daily expenditures, right?

521
00:22:29,257 --> 00:22:30,054
That's right.

522
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:32,359
Money doesn't fall from
the sky, you know?

523
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:35,440
And, you can't grow them too.

524
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:38,479
I'm talking to you.

525
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:40,479
Will you look for sponsors?

526
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:41,280
If we have to fork out

527
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,999
our own money all the time,

528
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:44,160
I don't think we can sustain this.

529
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:48,640
No effort goes in vain.

530
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:52,440
When we do good deeds,

531
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,119
do not bring them up.

532
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:59,239
When we truly can't afford
to sustain it,

533
00:22:59,239 --> 00:23:00,239
you can tell me by then.

534
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,479
Right now.

535
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:04,599
We're in the red already.

536
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:13,319
I...

537
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:24,839
Charge!

538
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:27,880
That buddy was listless during class.

539
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,719
Now that she's outside,

540
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,999
it's like she's on steroids.

541
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,959
She can do everything
except for studying.

542
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:33,640
If so, why did she join
the apprentice class?

543
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:34,920
Why don't you ask her?

544
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,609
Fine.

545
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:41,479
Tou, I have a question.

546
00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:43,079
Why did you join the apprentice class

547
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:44,079
when you hate studying?

548
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,440
As the saying goes,
gifts blind the eyes.

549
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:47,719
He already paid me.

550
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,239
I have to study TCM or cook

551
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:50,239
as long as he wants me to.

552
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:52,359
So, a cook like you is studying TCM?

553
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:53,719
That's quite a huge leap.

554
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:55,719
That's none of your business.

555
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:02,719
Let me clarify something.

556
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:03,920
Only take what we need.

557
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,640
I won't pay for anything
outside the list.

558
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:09,119
I can buy snacks with the money
I save, right?

559
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,313
No.

560
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,359
Why not?

561
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:15,440
No means no.

562
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,119
It's not like snacks are expensive.

563
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:18,319
You will only buy the things

564
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:19,199
that are written on the list.

565
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,359
Excuse me.

566
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,239
Sorry for the interruption.

567
00:24:21,239 --> 00:24:23,239
I'm running a business nearby.

568
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:24,400
-Can I...
-No, thanks.

569
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:27,719
Can I add you on WeChat?

570
00:24:27,719 --> 00:24:30,359
-What kind of business?
-I'm running a nail salon.

571
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:31,893
Sure.

572
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:33,000
Really?

573
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,460
I added you.

574
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,719
Okay. Thank you.

575
00:24:40,735 --> 00:24:41,607
Don't mention it.

576
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,520
You're really bold, aren't you?

577
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,839
Do you know

578
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:49,599
that she can steal your
personal information, bank details,

579
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:51,239
and your money from that scan?

580
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,640
You have no safety awareness at all.

581
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,920
What a coincidence.

582
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,239
First, there's no money
in my bank account.

583
00:24:56,239 --> 00:24:57,032
Second,

584
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:58,319
she's cute.

585
00:24:58,719 --> 00:24:59,839
If she tries to take advantage of me,

586
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,999
I think it's my gain instead.

587
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:03,263
Am I right?

588
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:12,959
You were fine just now.

589
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:14,280
What's wrong? Get up!

590
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:15,166
My tummy hurts!

591
00:25:17,239 --> 00:25:18,999
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

592
00:25:18,999 --> 00:25:20,680
Miss, is it abdominal pain
or stomach pain?

593
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,719
Stomach pain.

594
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:22,959
I had diarrhoea today.

595
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:23,959
I didn't have lunch today.

596
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,440
This is a case of Tai Yin disease.

597
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,265
What disease?

598
00:25:26,479 --> 00:25:28,119
-Tai Yin disease.
-Are you on your period?

599
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:30,199
Do you take

600
00:25:30,199 --> 00:25:31,119
cold food and drinks usually?

601
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:31,959
Should we call an ambulance?

602
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:32,760
Wait.

603
00:25:33,239 --> 00:25:34,440
I think she's on her period.
She forgot to have lunch too.

604
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,297
That's why her blood sugar level is low.

605
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:37,280
-Should we call 120?
-What's the matter?

606
00:25:37,479 --> 00:25:39,040
Should we call an ambulance?

607
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,479
Can you get me some brown sugar water?

608
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:41,359
She might be suffering from
hypoglycaemia.

609
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,520
Who are you guys?

610
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,599
We're doctors.

611
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,802
(Xu Meng)

612
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,837
Shan Dao.

613
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:07,944
(Senior.)

614
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,319
(Do you intend to bring the kids)

615
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:11,119
(to Mount Huafeng during
Qingming Festival?)

616
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,239
(Do you lack anything?)

617
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:13,359
Nope.

618
00:26:13,479 --> 00:26:14,640
Ling Lan will prepare everything.

619
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:15,680
Are you going?

620
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:17,440
I have several meetings to attend.

621
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,479
Let's see how it goes.

622
00:26:18,479 --> 00:26:21,599
However, I checked the weather forecast.

623
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:23,359
(It would be raining on those few days.)

624
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:25,680
You have to prepare
some raincoats and boots.

625
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,800
The road condition there is terrible.

626
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,959
Great suggestion.

627
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:30,160
I'll tell Ling Lan about it.

628
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,760
Say, is Ling Lan beside you?

629
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,560
Nope. She's busy with something else.

630
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:37,839
I called you

631
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:41,599
because I have something important
to tell you.

632
00:26:41,999 --> 00:26:42,999
What is it? Speak up.

633
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:46,239
(Don't you want to take a walk with me?)

634
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:51,567
Is it something huge?

635
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:57,712
Ren.

636
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,599
What is it?

637
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:01,719
You're being so mysterious.

638
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:03,959
It's about Little Lark.

639
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:05,400
What a coincidence.

640
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,160
When I was performing outpatient duty,

641
00:27:07,199 --> 00:27:08,560
I encountered an outlander patient.

642
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,959
He said a divine healer
went to their place.

643
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:12,479
And, that divine healer was the one

644
00:27:12,719 --> 00:27:14,440
who recommended him to our hospital.

645
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,239
What has this got to do
with Little Lark?

646
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:21,359
My guess is that the divine healer
is Little Lark herself.

647
00:27:24,199 --> 00:27:27,319
I've already inquired about her looks
and age.

648
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:28,239
It's pretty close.

649
00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:30,040
And, according to what the patient said,

650
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,640
she received professional training

651
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,479
for her career.

652
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:35,800
She's not a casual practitioner.

653
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:38,479
There's one more thing
that makes it more interesting.

654
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,880
That divine healer is staying on

655
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:43,560
Mount Huafeng's hillside.

656
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,079
That's why I dare to assume

657
00:27:47,486 --> 00:27:49,846
that the divine healer
is Little Lark herself.

658
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:53,479
I think she still misses you.

659
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:57,760
And, she knows that you'll visit
that place every year.

660
00:28:10,719 --> 00:28:11,647
What do you think?

661
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,040
You must be tempted.

662
00:28:26,199 --> 00:28:27,159
Listen.

663
00:28:27,479 --> 00:28:29,239
Add some yogurt to it later.

664
00:28:29,239 --> 00:28:30,040
It'll taste better.

665
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:31,303
Got it?

666
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:33,079
Tou,

667
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:34,959
you're truly a culinary expert indeed.

668
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:38,199
I plan

669
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:39,359
to make this fruit salad

670
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:40,479
as nice as possible.

671
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:42,319
We can use it to curry favour

672
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:43,199
with the elite student.

673
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,359
I'll try to make her

674
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:46,400
share her notes

675
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,304
with us.

676
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,015
Rebecca,

677
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,319
are you done with your workout?

678
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,544
Good job.

679
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:11,440
I prepared some delicious

680
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:13,359
fruit salad for you.

681
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:14,263
Here you go.

682
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:15,959
I'm on a diet.

683
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,319
I used sugar-free yogurt.

684
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:25,199
It won't affect your diet.

685
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:26,192
Here.

686
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:29,839
I don't take fruits.

687
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:34,119
That's pretty unique.

688
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:35,160
I'll remember that.

689
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,959
Your notes are very complete.

690
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:39,959
Lawyers are detailed
and meticulous indeed.

691
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,004
What about this?

692
00:29:41,199 --> 00:29:42,119
Why don't you share your notes

693
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:44,119
with the rest of the class?

694
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,216
Why should I?

695
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,119
So that we can identify the leaks
and improve together.

696
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,188
No.

697
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:49,640
I paid attention in class

698
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,760
and worked hard to jot down the notes.

699
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,719
You guys didn't.

700
00:29:51,719 --> 00:29:53,079
What gives you guys the right

701
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:53,999
to enjoy the fruit of my labour?

702
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:56,239
You're acting like
my primary school deskmate.

703
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:58,239
It's not like there's
a bottom-out system in place.

704
00:29:58,359 --> 00:29:59,359
What's wrong with sharing your notes?

705
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:00,760
Although that's the case,

706
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:02,359
there's a difference between
elites like me and you all.

707
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:03,640
Since I worked hard on it,

708
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,640
that means I'm capable

709
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,599
and I'm the better one.

710
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:07,719
Anyway, it's unfair for lazy
people and hard-working people

711
00:30:07,719 --> 00:30:09,640
to achieve the same result.

712
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:12,359
My goodness.

713
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:14,319
So, you think you won't need

714
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:15,999
other people's help
for the rest of your life?

715
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:19,519
Fine.

716
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:21,872
Fine.

717
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:30,663
This is great.

718
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:48,479
Where did you go?

719
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:50,816
I went to take a walk.

720
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:52,560
Why didn't you invite me?

721
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:54,280
We should've gone there together.

722
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:56,319
You could take your walk
while I could practice boxing.

723
00:30:59,999 --> 00:31:00,983
Sun Tou Tou,

724
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,479
where's my blanched kale?

725
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,599
It's outside.

726
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,319
I told you before.

727
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,599
I only take blanched kale.

728
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:08,824
You see,

729
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:10,599
kale is pretty bitter.

730
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:13,359
It'll taste better if you add
some minced meat and garlic.

731
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:21,640
Roubecca, you're something else.

732
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:23,319
You only take cucumbers?

733
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:24,440
Do you think you're a rabbit?

734
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:30,479
Look at all these dishes.

735
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:31,920
Coming.

736
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:35,239
This is the last dish.

737
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:37,119
Tou Tou, did you make all of them?

738
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:38,319
Of course.

739
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:39,640
Not bad at all.

740
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,454
Nephew,

741
00:31:40,479 --> 00:31:42,239
try the Shredded Pork with Garlic Sauce
you ordered.

742
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,479
Try it. Are you doing face reading here?

743
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:00,688
It's pretty good.

744
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:03,032
That's it?

745
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:04,215
Yeah.

746
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,593
Tou Tou.

747
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,040
When Mr Ren says

748
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:09,079
"pretty good", that's the best remark

749
00:32:09,199 --> 00:32:10,640
you can get from him.

750
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,760
Is that so?

751
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,880
He had me for a second.
I thought it wasn't good.

752
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,319
Everyone, eat up.

753
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:16,560
-You compliment people like that?
-Let's dig in.

754
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:17,557
Try my cooking.

755
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,280
By the way, Niece-in-law,

756
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:36,229
Nephew,

757
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,440
we met a girl in the supermarket today.

758
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:39,999
Her tummy was aching so badly

759
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,319
that she couldn't straighten her back.

760
00:32:41,479 --> 00:32:43,079
This kid went to her

761
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,484
and gave her two needles.

762
00:32:45,472 --> 00:32:46,312
She recovered immediately.

763
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:47,719
He was amazing.

764
00:32:47,719 --> 00:32:49,239
I do believe in the power of acupuncture
after today.

765
00:32:49,479 --> 00:32:50,367
Is that so?

766
00:32:50,977 --> 00:32:51,860
Son,

767
00:32:51,959 --> 00:32:53,400
tell us about your glorious history.

768
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:55,119
Mum, don't listen to her.

769
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:56,319
You're being modest now?

770
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,239
Madam Song, it's like this.

771
00:32:57,239 --> 00:32:58,999
I read the pulse of that girl.

772
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:00,479
According to the pulse reading

773
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,680
and the fact that she had diarrhoea,

774
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,119
I deduced that it was a case
of Tai Yin disease.

775
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:04,760
Tian Zhen and Shi Yan thought

776
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,839
that she felt giddy

777
00:33:06,199 --> 00:33:07,640
due to hypoglycaemia
as she didn't eat the entire day.

778
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:10,599
I assumed that she was
going to have her period soon.

779
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,599
How did you treat her then?

780
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:14,959
I targeted her thenar muscle,
Nei Guan Meridian, and He Gu Meridian.

781
00:33:15,239 --> 00:33:16,839
She was fine when
I read her pulse again.

782
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:17,760
I assume that she recovered.

783
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,079
That was mystical.

784
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,599
She recovered immediately

785
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:24,440
after getting pricked by needles.

786
00:33:24,479 --> 00:33:26,319
I'm serious. It worked immediately.

787
00:33:30,479 --> 00:33:31,640
Where is she now?

788
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:35,999
I don't know.

789
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,094
She looked fine to me.

790
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:38,640
We didn't keep her contact number.

791
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:39,640
None of you kept it?

792
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,814
Nope.

793
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:44,359
Hurry and look for her!

794
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:47,959
Where can we find her?

795
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:50,239
I know!

796
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:53,359
She can be found at the alley
behind the supermarket.

797
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,560
No. 7, Zimu Street.

798
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:57,959
I'll send her contact number
to you guys through the group chat.

799
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,753
Wait!

800
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:01,359
You guys are done with lunch?

801
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,263
Tou,

802
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,479
how did you know her address?

803
00:34:06,239 --> 00:34:07,199
I scanned the QR code for her profile.

804
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,679
Do you want some water?

805
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,697
Dad.

806
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,064
Mum.

807
00:34:27,318 --> 00:34:28,198
She's fine now.

808
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,199
She just underwent
a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.

809
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,920
You started reading pulse
when you were four.

810
00:34:47,479 --> 00:34:48,400
You started studying TCM under me
when you were seven.

811
00:34:48,959 --> 00:34:49,880
You studied under me for 20 years.

812
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,880
20 years, you know?

813
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,880
What exactly

814
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,760
did you learn?

815
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,288
Mr Ren,

816
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,319
we couldn't tell too.

817
00:35:03,319 --> 00:35:04,760
That girl was so young.

818
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,760
Who would've expected her
to have eccyesis?

819
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,712
I wasn't talking to you.

820
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:10,359
If we didn't manage

821
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:11,400
to save the girl today,

822
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,359
you would've killed her
with a license in your hand!

823
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,328
Li Quan.

824
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,760
You should head back first.

825
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:42,479
This should be the one.

826
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,805
Roubecca,

827
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,279
you do have a unique preference
for dolls, huh?

828
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,635
No.

829
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,920
That's not the Tai Yin Meridian.

830
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,620
This is Tai Yin Meridian.

831
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,680
That's not true.

832
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,000
My nephew said

833
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,079
that the area is Yang
if it's facing the sunlight.

834
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:08,640
It's Yin when the sunlight
can't get to it.

835
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,400
Look at your own elbows. They're tanned.

836
00:36:10,463 --> 00:36:11,943
That's why the Tai Yin Meridian
isn't located there.

837
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,839
Weren't you sleeping during class?

838
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:20,920
I was just absorbed.

839
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,640
Elite student, huh?

840
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,319
You're just good at memorizing things.

841
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,599
Don't touch it.

842
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:30,400
Fine.

843
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,079
I won't touch it.

844
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,359
Is this your Jigglypuff?

845
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,079
This is the doll I use to learn

846
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,000
meridians and acupressure points.

847
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,680
Jigglypuff is for kids.

848
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,680
You even prepared this as well?

849
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,319
I, Rebecca,
never fight a battle unprepared.

850
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:47,877
Amazing.

851
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,476
You do live up to your name
as an elite student.

852
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,136
Lend it to me.

853
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,359
This is my learning tool.

854
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:55,480
If you want one,

855
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,160
you can buy it online.

856
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,680
You're so petty.

857
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,119
Fine, I'll buy one myself.

858
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,079
What's the name of this product?

859
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,680
Is it rubber doll?

860
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,640
After that, find the elbow.

861
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,319
Starting from here, three, four, five.

862
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:27,920
You went overboard today.

863
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,553
Get up.

864
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,920
Get up.

865
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,599
Are you saying that
I've criticized your son too harshly?

866
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,079
Just look at your son.

867
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:43,880
He's fine.

868
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,872
But you?

869
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,920
If it weren't for Tou Tou

870
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,160
and us,

871
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,279
I assume

872
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,680
that girl would've been gone.

873
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:58,079
I think

874
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,200
that's understandable.

875
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,319
Think about it. Our son just received
his medical license.

876
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,720
And he's not an official doctor yet.

877
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,553
They just

878
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,160
met a person who was
in need of assistance

879
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,480
in the supermarket.

880
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,380
Besides, Peng Shi Yan was around too.

881
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,079
Peng Shi Yan studies Western medicine.

882
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,400
He has a different medical speciality.

883
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,640
He's in the Department of Paediatrics.

884
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,240
It's understandable for him to
have no idea what to do.

885
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,039
But our son comes from a family of

886
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,960
TCM practitioners and specialises
in obstetrics and paediatrics.

887
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,640
How could he not know what to do?
That doesn't make sense!

888
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:28,960
Your son was right.

889
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,599
We shouldn't have forced him
to study TCM.

890
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,640
This kid

891
00:38:34,319 --> 00:38:35,480
isn't cut out for this field.

892
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,319
Have you not committed a mistake before?

893
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,720
Did you forget what happened
to Master Chen Fu?

894
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,160
As doctors,

895
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:54,240
we grow alongside
the life and death of patients.

896
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,720
It may sound cruel,

897
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,079
but that's the truth.

898
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,200
Your son is only 26 years old this year.

899
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,680
How old are you?

900
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,440
You used the term "kill".

901
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:07,680
That was pretty harsh of you.

902
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,920
Aren't you afraid
that it'll ruin his confidence

903
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,400
in practising medicine?

904
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:13,880
Confidence?

905
00:39:14,759 --> 00:39:16,200
Confidence, my foot.

906
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,440
He's just a snowflake.

907
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,759
You dote on your son.

908
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:25,000
His grandparents dote on him.

909
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,559
All of our relatives dote on him.

910
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,200
You guys will clean up his mess

911
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,079
when he commits mistakes.

912
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:33,960
You're doing it to look after
that fragile dignity of his.

913
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:38,400
In front of a patient's life,

914
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,240
confidence and dignity

915
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,079
mean nothing.

916
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,319
You don't care about him usually.

917
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,839
You only reprimand him
when he makes a mistake.

918
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,359
What gives us the right
to be his parents then?

919
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:51,559
As parents,

920
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,119
don't you think we should
be responsible for our child?

921
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,400
Sun Tou Tou doesn't have parents.

922
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,200
Who'll be responsible for her then?

923
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,025
Being responsible, huh?

924
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:08,400
We should always be responsible
for our own actions.

925
00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:10,160
Come and practice your writing.

926
00:40:14,759 --> 00:40:15,759
No, I won't.

927
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:18,000
Do you think I can practice
my writing nonchalantly

928
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:19,160
like you

929
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,160
after reprimanding our son?

930
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,559
Listen.

931
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:25,400
I still haven't improved
after all these years

932
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,720
all because of you.
You make me angry all the time.

933
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,359
After I get angry,

934
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,901
I have to take my time

935
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,480
to digest my emotions.

936
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,049
That's absurd.

937
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,640
What's absurd?

938
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,180
The ink hasn't been ground yet.

939
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,344
Tian Zhen,

940
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,920
your father must've reprimanded you.

941
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,160
This isn't entirely your fault.

942
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,160
We're at fault too.

943
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,680
There's a bad thing about
Western medicine.

944
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:09,480
Our specialities are way too different
from each other.

945
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,359
I...

946
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,680
I can't do anything

947
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,079
when it comes to O&G issues.

948
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:17,680
Speaking of which,

949
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,480
you TCM practitioners
are much better than us.

950
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,200
You have to know every
worldly knowledge there is.

951
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,640
And, you have to be familiar
with all kinds of diseases.

952
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:24,599
You guys are just like deities.

953
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,785
Your parents

954
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,319
are amazing figures indeed.

955
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,880
At first, I did suspect it.

956
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,599
I should've told that girl

957
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:34,200
to get a check-up in the hospital.

958
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,839
It's all because of Tou Tou.

959
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,240
Besides,

960
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,480
that girl

961
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,839
looked like a decent girl.

962
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,319
Who has rubber dolls?

963
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,480
We can talk about the dolls next time.

964
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,839
See what you would like to eat.

965
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,759
This is tomorrow's menu.

966
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:03,160
Is there anything you want to have?

967
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,599
What's wrong?

968
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,119
Did that girl die?

969
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,041
Nonsense.

970
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,009
Stop jinxing it.

971
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:19,880
We saved her.

972
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,839
You had me for a second there.

973
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,079
What's with the long face then?

974
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,759
One of her Fallopian tubes was removed.

975
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,079
How many Fallopian tubes
does a woman have?

976
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,260
Two.

977
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,440
That means she has one left, right?

978
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,421
That's fine, right?

979
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,319
What illness does she have?

980
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,759
My nephew and niece-in-law
were quite nervous about it.

981
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,680
It's eccyesis.

982
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,759
Eccyesis?

983
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,069
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

984
00:42:49,193 --> 00:42:50,621
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)
