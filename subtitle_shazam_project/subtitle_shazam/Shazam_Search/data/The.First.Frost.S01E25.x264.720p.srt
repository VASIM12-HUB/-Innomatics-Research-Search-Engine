[3646 Days]

51
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,260
These past days, I've traveled to many places.

52
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,610
From Nanwu to Yihe, then to Beiyu.

53

I've been everywhere she might have gone.

54
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,700
And suddenly, I realized...

55
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,540
how small her world was,

56
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,490

She didn't tell me where she is.

65

What do you mean by that?

68
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,250
Maybe in those six years away from us,

69
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,460
she bore a lot on her own.

70

Now, leaving again,

71
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,220

What was on her mind back then?

75
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,730

Choosing the right school is just as important.

00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:01,980
Scream?

344
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,380
Do you want everyone to know?

345
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,660
Do you think anyone will marry you later, Jiang?

346
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,330
Do you even realize

347
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,940
how shameful, how humiliating this is?

348
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,010
Don't scream!

349
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:11,700
Uncle Wen!

350
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,140
Uncle Wen, help me!

351
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:24,770
Come here.

352
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,730
Don't touch me!

353
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,810
I'll jump!

354
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:36,940
Yifan!

355
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:38,530
De!

356
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,620
- De! - Yifan!

357
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,940
What's going on here?

358
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,330
- Are you alright? - De, say something!

359
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,700
You're not dead, right, De?

360
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,900
- Yifan! - Say something!

361
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,900
I need to call the police...

362
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:49,900
You're not dead?

363
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,220
You scared me to death!

364
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,140
What are you waiting for?

365
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,330
Come help already!

366
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,940
Get them up first!

367
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,380
Look at your daughter.

368
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,380
I worked so hard raising her for you,

369
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,090
letting her stay in my house.

370
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:01,770
And what did she do?

371
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,940
She...

372
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,140
she wants to throw my brother in jail!

373
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:06,490
I'm sorry!

374
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,250
Please, don't be mad.

375
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,330
Don't be mad?

376
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,770
What did my brother do wrong?

377
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,770
He was just drunk

378
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,330
and went into the wrong room!

379
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,220
Look,

380
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,570
how heartless she is!

381
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,380
My brother didn't do anything to her,

382
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:16,860
and yet...

383
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,220
she let him fall and break his leg

384
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,290
and now she wants to slap him with...

385
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,700
a rape charge!

386
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,380
How can you throw around accusations like that?

387
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,090
Calm down.

388
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,570
It really pains me!

389
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,980
I'll go talk to her.

390
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,050
Jiang,

391
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,380
did you misunderstand something?

392
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,140
Your aunt's brother is a good man.

393
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,860
He would never do something like this.

394
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,770
Why are you all arguing?

395
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,770
Don't overthink it, okay?

396
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,530
If you want to argue, take it outside.

397
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,050
Go argue somewhere else.

398
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,250
We're not arguing.

399
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,250
Are you alright?

400
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,380
We can go to the police station.

401
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,490
It's quieter there.

402
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,180
Let's go make a statement.

403
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,050
Go on.

404
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,330
Tell the officer

405
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,290
everything that happened.

406
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,380
A guardian can accompany her.

407
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,380
You can come along.

408
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:01,900
I...

409
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,420
I have to go now.

410
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,380
Uncle Zheng drove me here.

411
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,530
- He's still waiting outside. - Mom...

412
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,660
I'm begging you...

413
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,960
He has work tomorrow.

414
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,600
- Please... - You can't just leave now.

415
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,590
Your daughter's trouble isn't solved yet.

416
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,730
Help me!

417
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,860
Please don't abandon me again.

418
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,050
Call me if you need anything.

419
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:19,900
I'm leaving now.

420
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,730
"We'll talk later?" What do you mean?

421
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,010
You're really leaving?

422
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,810
Can we go now?

423
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,620
Your foot is hurt.

424
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:52,660
Take care.

425
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,530

426
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,620
has soaked into my bones.

427
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,220

428
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,940

430

Not really.

439
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,860

00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,460
and working part-time.

515
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,620
Aren't you exhausted?

516
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:20,810
It's fine.

517
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,900
Sit down. Let's talk.

518
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,250
I haven't finished cleaning up yet.

519
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,180
I'll help you.

520
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,250
No need!

521
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:26,900
No need, really.

522
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:30,810
Just sit down and chat.

523
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,730
It's been a long time.

524
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,530
How have you guys been?

525
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,530
Our dance training school is still running.

526
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,900
Come visit when you have time.

527
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,140
Alright.

528
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,900
Wash the dishes!

529
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,420
You still have time to chat?

530
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,460
- Take your time. I'll get back to work. - Unbelievable!

531
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:57,660
Thank you.

532
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,530
You're out of wine.

533
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,420
Let me buy you a drink.

534
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,690
No need. I should go.

535
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,340
It's fine. Don't be so polite.

536
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,610
Hey, get her a drink.

537
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,260
Put it on my tab.

538
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,380
Got it.

539
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,460
Really, I don't need one.

540
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:55,610
Where are you going

541
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,460
in the middle of the day?

542
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,090
Are you okay?

543
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:08,740
I'm fine.

544
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,610
What happened?

545
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,690
That guy was harassing a female customer.

546
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,300
Our boss took him away.

547
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:29,940
Zhuo.

548
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:30,780
He!

549
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:42,940
If I hadn't come looking for you,

550
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,740
you still dared to show up here?

551
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,210
I'm just here for a drink.

552
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,170
Did I do something to you?

553
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,130
Don't ever let me see you again.

554
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,650
Got it?

555
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,530
Alright.

556
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,690
Okay, I get it.

557
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:57,740
I get it.

558
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,420
I understand now.

559
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,260
I touched your little girl before,

560
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,170
so now you're mad, right?

561
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,820
Come on, we're all men here.

562
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,010
You should understand, right?

563
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:34,690
She's just an insignificant woman.

564
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,130
I almost had her.

565
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,340
Want me to tell you how it felt?

566
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,530
Come on.

567
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:34,490
Is that all you've got?

568
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,690

He!

570

Yan is here!

571
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,490
Boss.

572
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,780
How are you?

573
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,860
Call an ambulance for him.

574
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,090
Hurry up!

Don't you think

578
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,420
watching horror movies helps you forget things?

579
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,010
No other genre works?

580
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,460
Seems like horror movies work best.
