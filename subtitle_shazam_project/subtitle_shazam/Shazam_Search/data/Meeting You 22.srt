00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,410
♫ The moment you pass by my side ♫

3
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,690
♫ Smiling ♫

4
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:35,150
♫ You entered my heart ♫

5
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:41,750
♫ How happy the two of us are under the clear sky ♫

6
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,750
♫ The promise we once made ♫

7
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,780
♫ Is like a love song echoing in the bottom of the heart ♫

8
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,540
♫ Laughter replaces silence ♫

9
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:59,010
♫ Like dazzling fireworks ♫

10

♫ Meeting you like this, getting closer unintentionally ♫

11
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,230
♫ The silence melts away, because I can't help it ♫

12
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,040
♫ It's like I feel a connection with you,  ♫

13
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,490
♫ But I'm unwilling to trust it easily ♫

14
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,790
♫ Meeting you like this has filled me with surprises ♫

15
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:26,950

[MEETING YOU]

19
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,500
Xiarui!

20
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,760
Where are you going?

21
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,380
I...am staying...
I am staying outside for two days.

22
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,720
Staying outside?
I just saw you.

23
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,580
Oh my goodness! Are you staying in
with that boyfriend of yours?

24
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:15,040
My god, girl!
Do you want everyone to hear it?

25
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,660
How about this?
You help me to keep this a secret.

26
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,280
I will pay for all your milk tea
for this month. Okay?

27
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,680
But, it's almost the end of the month.

28
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,500
I will also pay for next month, alright?

29
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,300
Now that's more like it!
I will help you carry your luggage.

30
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,460
But, let me tell you.

31
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,840
There are things you need be
mindful of when living together.

32
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,620
I read an online comment
from someone saying that

33
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,720
staying together is one
of the reasons why couple break up.

34
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,100
You better be careful.

35
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,680
I treat you for milk tea
and you treat me like this?

36
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,460
I am not cursing you.
I am worried about you.

37
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,780
Also, what was his explanation on the photos two days ago?

38
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,020
I saw it with my eyes. You went crazy

39
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,060
when you saw photos of him
dancing with other people.

40
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,520
Yang Yufei?

41
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,260
Oh, no. You misunderstood.
That's just a misunderstanding.

42
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,460
- Slowly.
- Okay.

43
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,910
- Watch your hand.
- Alright.

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,350
This is the last box.

45
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,940
Did I bring too much stuff?

46
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,880
How can it be? Not much.

47
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,340
But, we need to move it upstairs later.

48
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,250
Do you want to move it now or later?

49
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,420
Let's move it now.

50
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,060
But... suddenly, I don't have energy.
No energy at all.

51
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,920
Then, do you want to rest for awhile?

52
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,380
I think I probably need to recharge.

53
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,000
Recharge.

54
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,580
What are you doing?

55
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,440
Oh no. Oh no.
I am about to shut down. I am done for.

56
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,500
Low battery.

57
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,120
Alright, fully recharged!

58
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,410
[EPISODE 22]
[LET'S STOP BEING FRIENDS WITH THEM]

59
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,920
Xiarui, are you finished?

60
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,000
Still not done?

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,800
I am done!

62
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,380
- You are done?
- Yeah.

63
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,000
Let me introduce to you.
This pile over here are clothes

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,740
that are okay to wear again
since they're not dirty.

65
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,460
I can just wear them again.
Over there are my pants.

66
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,040
Also, for these jackets,
you can grab them on the go.

67
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,880
As for shoes, I will just
slip on the ones I see.

68
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,560
As for these books,
they are neatly put here.

69
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,200
Look, grab one of it and there's
hospitality management.

70
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,440
Isn't it convenient?

71
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,680
I hung up the clothes here
to prevent wrinkling.

72
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,840
Over here are my beauty products.

73
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,740
Am I an expert in storage?

74
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,280
As long as you are comfortable,
then it's fine.

75
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,480
Nanxi, Nanxi.

76
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,420
Boss Yi wants me
to bring you along to work tomorrow.

77
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,100
I don't know what he is planning.

78
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,020
I will accompany you.

79
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,240
It's not you accompanying me.
He wants to meet you.

80
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,640
If I go there, it's considered
me accompanying you.

81
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,970
Come over here.

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,460
You are getting good at sweet talk lately.

83
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,260
Who taught you this?

84
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,480
Have you finished memorizing the text?

85
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,420
I am going to memorize it now, Nanxi.

86
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,960
Nothing, nothing.

87
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,580
I have helped you settle
the university forum issue.

88
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,880
Had it not been for Boss Yi intervening,

89
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,080
I would have blacklisted Yang Yufei.

90
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,540
Yang Yufei?

91
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,740
What does this
have anything to do with her?

92
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,100
Why are you taking it out on her?

93
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,660
Isn't she the one who uploaded the post?

94
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,580
Of course, it isn't her.

95
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,440
She is also a victim.

96
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,440
If she didn't upload the post,
then who did it?

97
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,780
It was her classmates,
who like spreading baseless rumors.

98
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,920
When Yang Yufei was in school,

99
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,500
didn't she have a crush on Nanxi?

100
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,080
Yes, she did.

101
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,960
But, Yang Yufei was not involved in it.

102
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,920
Also, I was in that class too.

103
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,420
You are spying on Nanxi?

104
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,980
How is this spying?

105
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,800
This is considered as caring, okay?

106
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,460
Moreover, Yang Yufei had contacted me,

107
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,660
to tell me that she will
help me delete the post.

108
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,760
The innocent need not do anything.

109
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,400
Just letting it to is the best response.

110
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,200
Didn't you have a crush on Yang Yufei?

111
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,040
What happened all of a sudden?

112
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,600
I, Binzi, am a person with principles.

113
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,420
I always focus on facts, not people.

114
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,300
Let me tell you.
Be careful with your words.

115
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,100
You might lose the people you love.

116
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,980
Okay.

117
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,340
Sorry to keep you waiting.

118
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,720
Oh my goodness.

119
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,220
How is he so handsome?

120
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,440
I want to add him on WeChat.

121
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,920
I see what you did there, Boss Yi.

122
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,420
Without him here,
your business wouldn't run.

123
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,400
I was wondering why
you asked Nanxi to come here.

124
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,340
It's because you wanted him
to be the mascot

125
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,520
to increase customer turnover.

126
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,200
I disagree with that.

127
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,180
I gave him the best spot in the cafe. Why?

128
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,640
So that he can appreciate your charm
while you work.

129
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,380
If you don't believe me,
ask him if he likes it or not.

130
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,000
Nanxi didn't even want to
come here to begin with.

131
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,120
You really are a fox.
Good with words, too.

132
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,660
You are misusing the idioms again.

133
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,280
Why does your Nanxi
have to be so attractive?

134
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,620
Look at them.

135
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,620
To show you my appreciation,

136
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,860
I will teach you the core technique
of making coffee, okay?

137
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,480
Deal!

138
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,100
It's a rare opportunity
to see our boss perform.

139
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,340
Is the camera focused?

140
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,740
Yes, of course.

141
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,460
Let me see, let me see.

142
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,480
What do you think?

143
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,020
Was it worth your tuition fees?

144
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,220
Master, please accept me as your disciple.

145
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,040
Stand up.

146
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,020
Hurry up and deliver the coffee
to the customer.

147
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,220
Wait, let me do a closeup.
Put it here.

148
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,020
When did you start this hobby?

149
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,420
As the only full-time employee here,

150
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,760
I have 3128 fans, you know?

151
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,860
My fan base is even larger than Nanxi's.

152
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,020
Then, you can do a live broadcast.

153
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,460
Don't people do
live mukbang broadcast lately?

154
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,160
You can do a live broadcast
just drinking coffee.

155
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,140
Good idea.

156
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,060
Let me take another picture.

157
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,140
Wow, you even put a filter on the picture.

158
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,340
Are the two of you done?

159
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,320
The coffee will get cold
if you don't stop talking about it.

160
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,460
Okay, okay, okay.

161
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,260
Whose salary should I deduct
if customers complain?

162
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,000
No, no, no.

163
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,500
Wow, if a person is handsome,

164
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,900
he looks good in every photo,
no matter it was taken.

165
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,560
Hey, what kind of photo is this?

166
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,620
This angle doesn't do justice to his face.
You still think he looks good?

167
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,540
He was just sitting down while
I took these. Why don't you try?

168
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,940
Okay then, I will try. Go away.

169
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,680
Oh my gosh.

170
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,520
Stretch your legs out.
Stretch them.

171
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,400
Pose for the camera. A handsome pose.

172
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,560
Yes, that's it!

173
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,260
Let me see, let me see, let me see.

174
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,040
Take it.

175
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,020
This photo looks better.

176
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:41,200
Hi, can you send us a copy of the photo?

177
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,920
Oh, I have a lot of photos. Do you...

178
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,300
No, no, no thanks.

179
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,380
Follow me. Follow me.

180
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,500
Nanxi!

181
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,400
Huh? What?

182
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,400
Nanxi!

183
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,180
What is happening?

184
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,860
Nanxi, Nanxi!

185
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,100
Did you just disconnect the internet?

186
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,000
In the future, the internet will be
off at eleven.

187
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,500
This..This is not a university dormitory!

188
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,640
Why did you disconnect the internet?
I am playing games! They will report me!

189
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,120
What time do you usually sleep?

190
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,820
When I am in the dormitory, I only sleep
when they disconnect the internet.

191
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,300
What time do you go to sleep now?

192
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,080
Now--
I slept a little late.

193
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,800
This is the second time this week that I saw you staying up till morning,
playing games.

194
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,920
It's not because I like this game
that I played it.

195
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,320
I played it just to kill time.

196
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,520
Kill time?

197
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,360
Didn't you stay up late, too?

198
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,520
I was watching a documentary
to get some inspiration.

199
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,000
So that's why I...

200
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,880
So...

201
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,360
So, that's why you stayed up late
playing games...

202
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,260
...just to accompany me?

203
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,200
I am going to sleep.

204
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,300
Xiarui.

205
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,400
I am sorry. It's my fault.

206
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,580
I disconnected the internet
without asking you.

207
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,520
So, you are just going to say sorry?

208
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,700
Or why don't I just reconnect
the internet for you?

209
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,440
There is no need.

210
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,840
Unless you play a game with me.

211
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,360
Can you?

212
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,300
Alright, let's play.

213
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,520
You laughed.

214
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,780
- I didn't.
- Give it to me.

215
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,300
- I didn't.
- You laughed.

216
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,180
- I didn't.
- My turn.

217
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,880
You laughed. Come, come, come.

218
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,240
I don't want to.

219
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,100
I want to draw on you.

220
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,860
♫ Passing by the roads
you walked step by step ♫

221
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,100
- You laughed!
- I didn't.

222
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,500
Why are you still fooling around?
♫ Being lonely among the traffic lights ♫

223
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,700
Are you this brave now?
♫ Forgetting too many sad memories ♫

224
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,800
♫ Forgetting too many sad memories ♫

225
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,540
You can't draw me.
♫ My heart is now conflicted ♫

226
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,760
Nanxi drew too much on your face.

227
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,200
Who knew that this marker pen stain
would be hard to wash off?

228
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,480
Let me tell you.
Nanxi's face is no better than mine.

229
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,520
There's still a mole near his mouth.

230
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,960
I feel better when I think about it.

231
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,960
I don't know if it's still a good idea
for both of you to live together.

232
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,800
Hey, is Chubby Cheng helping
Si Bo to go after you?

233
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,360
It looked like Si Bo asked him
personally for help.

234
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,100
Or maybe it's like what they said.
They just happened to talk about me.

235
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,240
He's too stupid.

236
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,700
He's too slow.

237
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,140
He's...he's too insensitive.

238
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:32,420
Anybody could tell there was
a reason why Si Bo kept talking about you.

239
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,320
He is not just insensitive,
but hard-headed as wood.

240
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,240
You already gave him so many hints.
How come he still don't get it?

241
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,220
Yeah, it's been so long.

242
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,960
I thought that he would
understand me by now.

243
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,140
You also know that we girls
mature earlier than boys.

244
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:53,340
I thought I could wait.
Three years, five years, ten years.

245
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,840
But now, even when someone pursues me,

246
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,320
he still isn't bothered by it
and just goes with it.

247
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,620
I don't think I can't wait any longer.

248
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,900
It's also my fault.

249
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,920
I was so busy moving out that
I had no time to teach him.

250
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,200
Seriously.

251
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,980
It's okay.
Actually, that's his own matter.

252
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,540
Good thing I am busy recently.

253
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,680
Busy with rehearsals. My first TV show started script reading.

254
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,490
I don't need to think of
all those messy things.

255
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,780
Finally others will get to
see my precious friend.

256
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,280
Congratulations!

257
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,680
What are you guys talking about?
You both look happy.

258
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,600
I will go back to rehearsals first.

259
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,980
Don't... don't... Shu.
Why do you leave when you see me?

260
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,880
Are you still mad at me?

261
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,420
It's has nothing to do with you.

262
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,880
You...Why are you avoiding me recently?

263
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,680
Stop interrupting her rehearsals, alright?

264
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,680
How about this?

265
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,880
Tonight, both of you come to our house.

266
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,760
I haven't treated you both to a meal
after I moved out.

267
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,960
Tonight, Nanxi will be cooking.

268
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,400
Let's have a... a housewarming party.

269
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,780
What do you say?

270
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,300
What do you say?

271
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,660
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

272
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,220
The post was really taken down.

273
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,640
Could it be that
I misunderstood her before?

274
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,680
Binzi, seriously.

275
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,820
Xiarui already said that it was
a misunderstanding.

276
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,360
Not only you don't trust her,

277
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,080
but you also didn't sell any coffee
and was absent for half a day.

278
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,660
I would have forgotten about this matter.

279
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,160
I haven't deducted your salary
for your absence.

280
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,400
Don't overdo it, Boss Yi.

281
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,500
I am just helping Xiarui
clear her name.

282
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,500
Hmm, how generous of you.

283
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,260
This was just a simple misunderstanding.

284
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,700
It became more complicated
after you butted in.

285
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,580
Then, did I really misunderstand Yufei?

286
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,520
Hey, your general
has created a chance for you.

287
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,780
Boss Yi, did you do something
behind my back?

288
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:03,540
Young man. This is me helping you.

289
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,900
What do you want to drink?

290
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,520
One cup of latte, no sugar.

291
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,860
Alright.

292
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:18,040
Who was the one who swore
not to sell me any coffee a few days ago?

293
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,760
Yufei. It's my fault.

294
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,560
I... I knew you were the one who took down
the post about Xiarui.

295
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,520
An apology is not enough.
You need to show me some sincerity.

296
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,740
Boss Yi, are you done with
the six cups of expresso that I ordered?

297
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,520
Coming!

298
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,440
Here you go, boss! Your coffee.

299
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,860
Do you really want Binzi
to finish all of these in one go?

300
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:48,400
Didn't you say that he wants
to prove his sincerity?

301
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,100
Drink all of these in one go?

302
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,480
Maybe you should forget it.

303
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,120
There's a proverb that says A real man is flexible.

304
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,920
Right?

305
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,320
Sometimes, a man should back down
when he can.

306
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,640
Forget it, forget it.

307
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,600
Don't stop me, boss.

308
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,460
I will drink it.

309
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,500
I, Binzi, always take responsibility
for my actions.

310
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,260
What's right, is right.
What's wrong, is wrong.

311
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,300
What a real man.

312
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,900
What a real man, indeed.

313
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,500
I didn't ask you to drink them all.

314
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,040
I am done.

315
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,440
Anyhow, Yufei.
I was wrong.

316
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,720
I shouldn't have treated you poorly
before finding out the truth.

317
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,960
Alright, I forgive you.

318
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,420
Really?

319
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,040
- Not satisfied?
- Satisfied, satisfied!

320
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,960
Boss Yi, I have class later.
I'll leave first.

321
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,820
Bye!

322
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,320
Goodbye.

323
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,440
You're welcome.

324
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,720
Alright, stop peeping!

325
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,000
Binzi, you already apologize
and confessed to her.

326
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,100
Why are you still acting?
Go and wash the cups!

327
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,420
Who confessed?

328
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,980
Nothing, nothing.

329
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:03,580
However, let me tell you,
these will be deducted from your salary.

330
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,440
Fine, I am in a good mood today.
Go ahead and deduct my salary.

331
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,950
But, I'd like to ask you something.
My heartbeat should be faster

332
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,300
after drinking these expressos.
How come I still feel so calm?

333
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:18,200
Well, maybe someone has secretly
add water into the expresso.

334
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,320
Boss Yi, you are the best.

335
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,580
Go away, go away!

336
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,740
I am worried that you lost your sanity
while apologizing.

337
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,950
Since you already added water,
you can't ask me to pay for six cups.

338
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,140
- The most is two cups.
- No, can't do!

339
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,240
Three cups!

340
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,320
Deal!

341
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,560
- Xiarui.
- Yes?

342
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,500
I have been wanting to ask you something.

343
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,920
Ask ahead.

344
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,680
Cohabitating... emm... no...

345
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,020
How's life staying in the same place?
Is it good?

346
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,620
You can't be serious.

347
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,500
Both of you have such good life now.

348
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,320
We have completely different habits
and schedules.

349
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,220
I like to sleep in through the morning.
He already woke me up at six am.

350
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:06,140
She just placed her stuff everywhere.
It's so messy that she put it outside.

351
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,940
Also, he especially likes to hide stuff.

352
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,220
I can never find it
whenever I need to use it.

353
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,980
Do you know that
she doesn't like to clean up?

354
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,620
He can mop for 800 times in one day.

355
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,580
I even think that
the floor wouldn't get so dirty easily.

356
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,940
She forgets to close the door
when she uses the toilet.

357
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:28,700
Also, he walks around without a sound.
It scared me in the middle of night

358
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,000
so much that I almost had a heart attack.

359
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,060
Well, from my perception, I don't think
it's suitable for you to live together.

360
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,620
Seeing this, I think that you will
break up sooner or later.

361
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,440
Impossible!

362
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,740
Come, Shu. Have some.

363
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,160
You only gave her vegetables?

364
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,620
Thank you.

365
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:52,300
Shu, you don't need to thank me.
I am not used to you thanking me.

366
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,460
You will get used to it.

367
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,260
Don't we have ice-cream in the fridge?

368
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,340
We have all flavours.
Later, you can eat any of it as you like.

369
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,540
I've been trying to quit sugar recently.
You guys just go ahead.

370
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:10,160
Shu, you don't need to lose weight.
You will become too thin if you do.

371
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,100
Xiarui, why did you kick me?

372
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:17,300
Just eat your food, alright?
And don't talk with your mounth full.

373
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,040
I'll go wash some more vegetables.

374
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,080
I'll help you.

375
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,720
Just eat!

376
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,640
Do you still remember Xiao Bailing
from our dormitory?

377
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,980
Xiao Bailing?
- Yes.

378
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:31,200
Her mother wants her to go matchmaking.
Oh my goodness.

379
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,220
What's the rush?
She hasn't graduated yet.

380
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:39,240
Also, Xiao Bailing is pretty.
Why the rush for matchmaking?

381
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,380
How is being pretty related
to matchmaking?

382
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,460
Shu, will your family also
arrange matchmaking for you?

383
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,260
How ridiculous!

384
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,000
It's ridiculous?

385
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,380
It's ridiculous!

386
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:53,480
People should be together because of love.

387
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,040
You see, for matchmaking,

388
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,880
everyone just state their conditions.

389
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,620
They compare candidates
with each other like in the market.

390
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,180
I don't think it's ridiculous.

391
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,240
The objective is there
along with the conditions.

392
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,760
If it's works, fine. If it doesn't,
just split up. I think it's good.

393
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,120
Shu, how can you be thinking like this?

394
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,160
Let's stop talking
about the matchmaking.

395
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,640
Aren't we celebrating
us moving in together?

396
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,060
- Come, come, come.
- Xiarui, wait.

397
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:27,160
Shu, I think that it's not good
for you to think so.

398
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,060
As a long time friend since a young age,

399
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,420
I...I should help you,
give you some advice.

400
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,760
Falling in love isn't something you trade
with others.

401
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,480
You need to find someone that you love.
That way you'll be happy.

402
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,520
How will you know that if I love him,
he also loves me back?

403
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,480
Shu, you have someone
that you love?

404
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,360
Who's the guy?
Do we know him?

405
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,580
Can't we just eat?

406
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,780
If we can't finish the food,
I will put all of it into your mouth.

407
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,880
Just eat!

408
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,360
Your saliva is all over the table.
Just continue eating.

409
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,300
Eat, eat, eat.

410
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,600
No, why are both of you
attacking me today?

411
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,560
Just eat.

412
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,220
Xiarui, I have to leave first.
I will see you tomorrow.

413
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,240
I will send you off.

414
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,960
Why are you leaving so soon?
There's still plenty of food.

415
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,440
She's walking home alone. It's dangerous.
Aren't you sending her off?

416
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,480
He doesn't have to.
I can walk home alone.

417
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,260
What are you doing?
Do you want me to beat you up?

418
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:25,750
Go. Hurry up. Pick up the pace.

419
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,260
Shu!

420
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,400
Oh my goodness.

421
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,600
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness.

422
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,740
Being their friend is tiring.

423
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,040
I am mentally tired.

424
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,160
Let's stop being friends with them.

425
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,140
We should have done so earlier.

426
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,720
We should stop bothering
with their issues.

427
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,780
We can't intervene.

428
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,640
Shu, Shu.

429
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,760
Shu, I want to talk to you.

430
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,180
Talk about what?

431
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:01,360
I think what you did today
was unacceptable.

432
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,780
What did I do?

433
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,000
You can lash out on me.

434
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,440
But, you can't do it to Nanxi and Xiarui.

435
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,120
It's hard for us to meet up together.

436
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,920
The meet up turned sour because of us.

437
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,780
What you meant to say is that
I am the party pooper, is it?

438
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,200
I will just open up the truth.

439
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,560
No matter what I said, you'll be angry.
I might as well tell you the truth.

440
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,560
You want me to be honest with you?

441
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,060
Okay, let me tell you.

442
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,160
Cheng Erluo, do you know that
you're a hopeless idiot?

443
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,240
I am angry but that's not the reason for my anger.

444
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,960
Everytime, you don't even
why I am angry.

445
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,440
You always think that I am
being unreasonable, right?

446
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,120
How could it be not?

447
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,280
I kept on thinking
about my mistakes recently.

448
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,100
I just didn't come and fetch you.
I already told you I was training.

449
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:49,920
In your eyes, I was easily provoked by
small matters, is it?

450
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,780
Let me tell you.

451
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,200
I am furious, but it's not because of
you missing out on picking me up.

452
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,780
The reason is because when I tried to distance myself from you

453
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,600
you kept on bonding with me.

454
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,580
When I tried to bond with you,
you ditched me cruelly.

455
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,520
I am angry because no matter what I said,

456
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,400
you being a blockhead will never get it!

457
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,800
What have I done wrong?

458
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,600
When did I ditch you cruelly?

459
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,920
Just like this!

460
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,100
If you want to quarrel, then fine.

461
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,900
Why did you become like Xiarui?

462
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,900
Xiarui, Xiarui.

463
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,180
Are you okay?

464
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,900
Stomachache.

465
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,940
Stomachache?

466
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,560
Yes.

467
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,960
Wait here.

468
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,680
Oh my gosh.

469
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,520
Come, drink this brown sugar soup.

470
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,600
Why do I need to drink this?

471
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,760
Don't ask any question. Just drink it.

472
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,820
I don't want to drink it.

473
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,020
No, you have to.

474
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,580
Have one more sip.

475
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,140
Come on.

476
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,880
Drink more.
It's good for you.

477
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,860
I don't want to drink it, Nanxi.

478
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,180
Okay, okay, okay.

479
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,660
Lay down.

480
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,160
What... what are you doing?

481
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,420
Why are you giving me a heating pad?

482
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,740
I asked Shu.

483
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,180
She said that this
is more comfortable.

484
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:30,040
If you are still in pain,

485
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,900
let's call her and ask her again.

486
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,600
What did you consult her on?

487
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,900
It's on.

488
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,040
It's on...that thing.

489
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:49,520
Well, don't your 'relatives' come
and visit you every month?

490
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,020
I asked her what can a man...do
during that time.

491
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,700
No... Nanxi.

492
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,800
I do not...

493
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,620
but I need to go to the toilet.

494
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,420
Come and sit down.

495
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,980
Let's take another sip.

496
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,060
Nanxi, it's not that.

497
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,700
It's not because of my period.

498
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:49,320
It's probably because of
the expired ice-cream.

499
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,140
You...You got a stomachache?

500
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,080
Yes.

501
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,520
When did you prepare
all of these things?

502
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,480
Tell me, is there anything else?

503
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,120
I just remembered that I still
haven't completed my assignment.

504
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,420
I am going to do so now.

505
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,120
The Woodie is getting embarrassed.

506
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,640
No.

507
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,040
Come on, it's still not good enough?

508
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,180
Three meters isn't enough for each floor.

509
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:40,220
Three meters is still not enough?

510
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:43,460
The height for public building
should be 3.9 meters for each floor.

511
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,300
There's a thirty meter difference.

512
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,220
You need to redo this building plan.

513
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,920
Oh, he's right.

514
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,400
What were you thinking
throughout the day?

515
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,680
You put only three meters for each floor.

516
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,900
Are you constructing an apartment?

517
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,300
It's easier to count that way.

518
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,560
Didn't you know there's a thing
called a calculator?!

519
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,080
How can you get into Binhai University
with this brain?

520
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,180
Don't you dare insult me!

521
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,540
You got chips on my building plan!

522
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,600
If you are so good, show Nanxi
your building plan!

523
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,280
I-I-I haven't finish drawing mine.

524
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,360
Nanxi, have you finish drawing yours?

525
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,320
Let us have a look.
We want to learn from it.

526
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,960
This is so meticulous!

527
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,900
Nanxi, you're a genius in architecture!

528
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,840
My graduation project might not be
as excellent as this.

529
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,880
Looks like you are a shoe in

530
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,020
for first place in midterm.

531
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,460
It's marvelous!

532
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:52,760
Senior, what are you doing here?

533
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,800
Professor Gu asked me to help out
with the design competition.

534
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,800
I happened to pass by.
So, I came in.

535
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,320
I heard that this year's
architecture design competition

536
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,600
will be held in our campus.

537
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,740
Also, I heard that

538
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:07,780
the winner will get to participate
in an exchange program in Italy.

539
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,120
Why both of you
knew everything?

540
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,700
How is this a secret?

541
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,520
It's nothing!

542
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,700
Are you interested
in taking part?

543
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,540
Hao Tian, I think both of us
can give it a try.

544
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,620
What if we got lucky

545
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,060
and we got the first place.

546
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,980
We will then be popular in campus.

547
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:28,820
No way. I was already badly
abused by Nanxi at home.

548
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,680
I don't want to get
humiliated in public again.

549
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,860
Come here to help me have a look.

550
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,220
Why did you give up easily?

551
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,540
What about you, Nanxi?

552
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,640
Interested in taking part?

553
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,700
Thanks, senior. But, I am not interested.

554
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:43,360
Your talent should be seen by the public.

555
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,460
Architecture isn't a competition.

556
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,380
It's okay

557
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,300
since the deadline for sign ups
is still a long way.

558
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,800
If you change your mind, go
and look for Professor Gu.

559
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,500
Thanks, senior!

560
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,560
Are you going to Cafe Yami?

561
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,420
Senior, you also know Cafe Yami?

562
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,900
Everyone knows it.

563
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,680
I heard that the coffee
and the environment there is good.

564
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,540
I happened to be free today.
Can you show me the way

565
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,460
so that I can try the coffee there?

566
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,160
Come, have a look.

567
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,200
How is it?

568
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,880
Eight points!

569
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,760
Not bad, Xiarui!

570
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,760
You have mastered
coffee art during the whole afternoon.

571
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,300
Looks like aside from having an
excellent sense of taste,

572
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,120
you have skills too.

573
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,140
You are my top student.

574
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,960
Nanxi, is it pretty?

575
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,260
It's pretty.

576
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,940
You are not listening to
a professional opinion from the master.

577
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,800
But you are asking him?

578
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,720
Aside from looking at you passionately
and telling you

579
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,100
the drink is good.

580
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,240
The food is good.

581
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,320
What else can he do?

582
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,340
The drink is delicious and pretty.

583
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,380
Then, it's good enough.

584
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,780
Try my first creation.
Try it, try it.

585
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,740
Even though this coffee is
for you to practice,

586
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,520
you can't simply give it others.

587
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,660
Is it good?

588
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,380
It's good.

589
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,500
Are you listening to what I am saying?

590
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,320
I will also let Si Bo try it
and get his opinion.

591
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,380
Is my business still running?

592
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,860
Is my business still running?

593
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,760
Why so stingy?
Just deduct it from my salary.

594
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,780
Looks like it doesn't matter whether
I am the boss.

595
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:46,360
I think it's best to give
the WBC invitation to someone else.

596
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,200
WBC?

597
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,720
Invitation?

598
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,620
And he is bragging about it.

599
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,340
I can only brag
about it now.

600
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,880
Is this for real?

601
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,860
Let me have a look.

602
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,560
It's my fault, it's my fault. Let me see.

603
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,980
Have a good look.

604
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,640
Is this real or fake?

605
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,020
You... you really have a hidden talent.

606
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,080
Your master is in the
coffee business for many years.

607
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:20,220
I just happened to see
through that world.

608
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,720
What is WBC?

609
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,880
It's the World Barista Competition. This is an exclusive competition.

610
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:30,000
Baristas who made their debut
at the competition are geniuses.

611
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,460
You also know that I am a relaxed person.

612
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,480
I don't like being in the competition.

613
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,100
But, I went to the WBC a few times.

614
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,080
They learn from each other,
which creates a good enviornment.

615
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,660
This year, they organized
another competition in Jiangzhou.

616
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:48,140
They specifically asked me to participate.

617
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:51,960
I am still considering
whether to go or not.

618
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,400
That's being ungrateful.

619
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,080
Others are dying for this chance
and you're still hesitant to participate.

620
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,640
What a show off!

621
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,340
How about you take my place
in the competition?

622
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,100
Be the representative of our cafe.
What do you say?

623
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,860
Are you joking? How can I
participate in such grand competition?

624
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:12,760
Young lady, this competition
is an excellent opportunity

625
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,540
for youngsters to practice their skills.

626
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:20,100
If you want to be a top barista,

627
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:25,000
aside from skills, your mentality is also important.

628
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,900
Learn from the experts.

629
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:32,100
Meeting the masters will benefit you.

630
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,640
Wouldn't I embarrass you if I participate?

631
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,200
I told you,
I don't bother with trivalities of life.

632
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,360
Why should I be afraid
of being humiliated?

633
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:44,480
Why is it that your words
don't sound encouraging at all?

634
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,640
Xiarui. Go and have a try.

635
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,220
No, this is a grand competition.
As a beginner,

636
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,540
isn't this a little too fast?

637
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,040
I believe in you.

638
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,140
But, I lack self-confidence.

639
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,560
Then I'll go with you.

640
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,620
To Jiangzhou?

641
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,900
Yes, to Jiangzhou.

642
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,520
Nanxi said he will go with you.

643
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,160
You should believe in yourself.

644
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,780
Am I making a hasty decision?

645
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,480
I now regret it a little bit.

646
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,850
What should I do
for the preliminary, Nanxi?
