00:23:05,723 --> 00:23:07,013
you're constantly afraid

345
00:23:07,773 --> 00:23:08,793
that one day

346
00:23:08,793 --> 00:23:10,013
she'll slip away

347
00:23:10,733 --> 00:23:11,863
and never come back?

348
00:23:12,973 --> 00:23:13,943
Are you totally into her?

349
00:23:14,423 --> 00:23:15,533
I feel like

350
00:23:15,533 --> 00:23:16,493
I'm a bit of a wimp

351
00:23:16,623 --> 00:23:17,733
in front of her.

352
00:23:18,053 --> 00:23:19,733
I can't say anything.

353
00:23:21,053 --> 00:23:22,103
I'm afraid

354
00:23:22,623 --> 00:23:23,703
that if I say even one wrong word,

355
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,293
she'll never talk to me again.

356
00:23:26,943 --> 00:23:27,623
Su Haoan.

357
00:23:27,733 --> 00:23:29,053
I can't believe there's someone you don't dare to court,

358
00:23:29,423 --> 00:23:30,493
but I have to say,

359
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:32,533
the more you don't dare,

360
00:23:32,943 --> 00:23:33,663
the more you have to court her.

361
00:23:33,973 --> 00:23:35,383
Just in case you really lose her

362
00:23:35,703 --> 00:23:37,533
because you keep putting it off.

363
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:38,223
Bro.

364
00:23:38,493 --> 00:23:40,103
I think I really need to talk.

365
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:42,253
Tomorrow night,

366
00:23:42,573 --> 00:23:43,943
come to Overtime, okay?

367
00:23:44,813 --> 00:23:46,253
Lately, I'm not free at night.

368
00:23:46,463 --> 00:23:47,773
What are you busy with at night?

369
00:23:47,903 --> 00:23:48,903
I'm

370
00:23:49,223 --> 00:23:50,253
confirming something.

371
00:23:50,423 --> 00:23:51,943
Confirming what? Tell me.

372
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:53,423
Recently,

373
00:23:54,293 --> 00:23:55,663
a girl wanted to hit on me,

374
00:23:57,013 --> 00:23:59,253
so I don't have time to deal with other people's business.

375
00:23:59,663 --> 00:24:00,223
Understand?

376
00:24:01,103 --> 00:24:01,813
It's fine if you don't tell me.

377
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:03,493
I'm not in the mood

378
00:24:03,493 --> 00:24:04,733
for your gossip today anyway.

379
00:24:05,053 --> 00:24:05,573
See you later.

380
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:08,663
If you need anything,

381
00:24:08,773 --> 00:24:09,813
feel free to ask me.

382
00:24:10,183 --> 00:24:10,903
Maybe...

383
00:24:11,943 --> 00:24:13,103
Maybe I will have time.

384
00:24:14,573 --> 00:24:15,333
Got it.

385
00:24:16,903 --> 00:24:17,423
See you later.

386
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,293
First Frost (Shuangjiang).

387
00:24:46,223 --> 00:24:47,973
Doesn't that mean Shuangjiang?

388
00:24:53,383 --> 00:24:54,013
Hello, everyone.

389
00:24:54,013 --> 00:24:55,143
My name is Wen Yifan.

390
00:24:55,863 --> 00:24:57,773
My hobby is dancing.

391
00:24:57,903 --> 00:24:59,663
My nickname is Shuangjiang

392
00:25:00,103 --> 00:25:01,383
because the day

393
00:25:02,253 --> 00:25:04,143
I was born was the first frost.

394
00:25:04,143 --> 00:25:05,533
Then my father gave me this nickname.

395
00:25:12,623 --> 00:25:14,423
So he always remembers it.

396
00:25:44,633 --> 00:25:46,063
Wen Shuangjiang.

397
00:25:53,253 --> 00:25:53,863
What's up?

398
00:25:54,943 --> 00:25:55,493
Nothing.

399
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:56,773
So you can hear me.

400
00:26:00,973 --> 00:26:01,813
Shuangjiang.

401
00:26:05,573 --> 00:26:07,053
I suddenly want to fall in love.

402
00:26:08,973 --> 00:26:10,013
In love

403
00:26:10,813 --> 00:26:11,623
with Sang Yan.

404
00:26:36,273 --> 00:26:37,383
Hey, Qiao.

405
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:41,143
♪Happy birthday to you♪

406
00:26:41,573 --> 00:26:45,293
♪Happy birthday to you♪

407
00:26:45,903 --> 00:26:53,223
♪Happy birthday to you♪

408
00:26:53,423 --> 00:26:54,663
Dian, happy birthday.

409
00:26:55,053 --> 00:26:55,813
Thank you.

410
00:26:55,863 --> 00:26:57,143
I held off all night

411
00:26:57,143 --> 00:26:58,973
and tried hard to wait until 12:00 to say this.

412
00:26:59,183 --> 00:26:59,663
How's that?

413
00:26:59,663 --> 00:27:00,663
Am I the first?

414
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:03,143
Are you free tomorrow?

415
00:27:03,463 --> 00:27:04,383
I'll treat you to dinner.

416
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:06,663
Are you free now?

417
00:27:07,253 --> 00:27:07,943
Right now?

418
00:27:10,143 --> 00:27:11,813
What are you doing tomorrow?

419
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:13,813
Why does it have to be today?

420
00:27:14,973 --> 00:27:15,863
I have something on my mind.

421
00:27:15,973 --> 00:27:17,103
If I don't

422
00:27:17,423 --> 00:27:18,183
figure it out tonight,

423
00:27:18,183 --> 00:27:19,223
I might not be able to sleep.

424
00:27:19,703 --> 00:27:20,493
What's that?

425
00:27:20,573 --> 00:27:21,333
Why is it so serious?

426
00:27:25,493 --> 00:27:27,663
It's my first time in this situation,

427
00:27:27,943 --> 00:27:29,253
so I don't have much experience.

428
00:27:30,103 --> 00:27:31,103
I want to be straight,

429
00:27:31,103 --> 00:27:32,103
but I'm afraid he'll think

430
00:27:32,383 --> 00:27:34,013
I'm up to something else.

431
00:27:36,013 --> 00:27:37,423
What are you talking about?

432
00:27:37,903 --> 00:27:38,973
Who are you plotting against?

433
00:27:39,573 --> 00:27:40,333
No.

434
00:27:44,533 --> 00:27:45,383
I want

435
00:27:46,493 --> 00:27:47,293
to court Sang Yan.

436
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:50,863
Really?

437
00:27:52,033 --> 00:27:53,003
Keep your voice down.

438
00:27:53,663 --> 00:27:54,143
So

439
00:27:54,383 --> 00:27:55,703
you finally figured it out?

440
00:27:56,293 --> 00:27:57,143
Doing your best to woo him?

441
00:27:57,143 --> 00:27:58,143
I'm definitely behind you.

442
00:27:58,143 --> 00:27:58,863
Really?

443
00:27:58,973 --> 00:28:00,383
Of course.

444
00:28:00,463 --> 00:28:02,143
Since we met,

445
00:28:02,143 --> 00:28:03,463
I've never heard of you

446
00:28:03,463 --> 00:28:04,533
trying to woo someone.

447
00:28:06,423 --> 00:28:07,383
Actually, I'm glad

448
00:28:07,383 --> 00:28:08,383
you told me that.

449
00:28:09,103 --> 00:28:10,383
We're close,

450
00:28:10,383 --> 00:28:11,383
but you never share

451
00:28:11,383 --> 00:28:12,733
what's on your mind with me.

452
00:28:14,423 --> 00:28:15,253
I'm sorry.

453
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:17,183
I didn't blame you.

454
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:18,333
Tell me.

455
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:19,773
Do you have any plans to court Sang Yan?

456
00:28:21,013 --> 00:28:22,863
I don't have any,

457
00:28:22,863 --> 00:28:24,183
so I wanted to ask you.

458
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:28,053
I don't like your type.

459
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:29,703
What's my type?

460
00:28:29,813 --> 00:28:31,383
I'm passionate. You don't like me?

461
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:33,703
You're sticking to me too much.

462
00:28:34,493 --> 00:28:36,493
He may not like too passionate courting.

463
00:28:38,493 --> 00:28:40,013
Then you can't be too passionate,

464
00:28:40,493 --> 00:28:41,973
but not too subtle either.

465
00:28:43,253 --> 00:28:44,423
That's too difficult.

466
00:28:46,973 --> 00:28:48,813
But I think the biggest difficulty is still

467
00:28:49,533 --> 00:28:51,013
that I don't have the courage.

468
00:28:52,183 --> 00:28:53,223
Wen Yifan.

469
00:28:53,223 --> 00:28:54,663
I won't allow you to say that about yourself.

470
00:28:54,663 --> 00:28:56,183
Who says you don't have courage?

471
00:28:56,463 --> 00:28:57,973
You've never relied on your family

472
00:28:57,973 --> 00:28:59,223
or given your friends

473
00:28:59,223 --> 00:29:00,703
any trouble.

474
00:29:00,943 --> 00:29:03,183
You've solved everything on your own.

475
00:29:03,903 --> 00:29:04,703
In my opinion,

476
00:29:04,703 --> 00:29:05,733
you're the bravest girl

477
00:29:05,733 --> 00:29:06,973
I know.

478
00:29:07,253 --> 00:29:09,333
That's like the sauce in this pizza.

479
00:29:09,663 --> 00:29:11,143
If it doesn't form strands,

480
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:12,813
it won't taste good,

481
00:29:13,423 --> 00:29:14,973
so you have to lay some strands

482
00:29:15,183 --> 00:29:16,813
on him every now and then

483
00:29:17,053 --> 00:29:19,293
to make him feel like you care about him.

484
00:29:19,573 --> 00:29:20,813
That way, he'll need you.

485
00:29:21,103 --> 00:29:22,053
That's like

486
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:23,423
a spider's web

487
00:29:23,663 --> 00:29:24,943
he can't escape from.

488
00:29:25,253 --> 00:29:26,773
Then, wait for him to confess to you.

489
00:29:26,863 --> 00:29:27,533
How's that?

490
00:29:28,623 --> 00:29:29,623
Is it really possible?

491
00:29:30,383 --> 00:29:31,143
I think so.

492
00:29:33,253 --> 00:29:34,773
Anyway, whatever you decide,

493
00:29:34,943 --> 00:29:36,183
I wish you a stunning success.

494
00:29:36,183 --> 00:29:37,183
Once and for all.

495
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,333
I want to be desperate this time

496
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,183
and run to that person

497
00:29:50,863 --> 00:29:51,943
without thinking about anything.

498
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:55,463
I also want to try

499
00:29:55,903 --> 00:29:57,463
to be that passionate person.

500
00:29:59,533 --> 00:30:00,773
I don't think

501
00:30:01,293 --> 00:30:02,293
it matters if I fail.

502
00:30:10,773 --> 00:30:11,703
I want

503
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:13,973
to try at least once.

504
00:30:17,253 --> 00:30:18,573
I want to court Sang Yan.

505
00:30:24,813 --> 00:30:25,863
The light is still on.

506
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:27,493
He doesn't seem to be sleeping.

507
00:30:30,363 --> 00:30:32,683
[Thank you for the gift]

508
00:30:35,243 --> 00:30:36,443
[Thank you]

509
00:30:38,563 --> 00:30:39,363
[Thank you]

510
00:30:51,253 --> 00:30:52,183
Get an early night.

511
00:30:58,143 --> 00:30:59,013
Get an early night.

512
00:31:04,183 --> 00:31:05,103
So

513
00:31:07,383 --> 00:31:09,053
on your birthday,

514
00:31:09,053 --> 00:31:09,903
I'll

515
00:31:10,293 --> 00:31:11,383
give you a gift back.

516
00:31:12,813 --> 00:31:13,973
