Don't worry, Tian.

Your baby needs to rest

Or is all of this

222
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:03,743
an arbitrary act?

223
00:11:05,773 --> 00:11:07,413
Do you think my kid

224
00:11:07,413 --> 00:11:08,293
will ask me where their dad is

225
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,173

Don't think too much.

So?

358
00:19:17,383 --> 00:19:19,413

359
00:19:20,303 --> 00:19:20,893
What?

360
00:19:22,143 --> 00:19:23,583
I'm not very hungry.

361
00:19:24,213 --> 00:19:24,933
I know.

362
00:19:32,343 --> 00:19:33,143
The noodles you cooked

363
00:19:37,893 --> 00:19:39,063
are pretty tasty.

364
00:19:42,783 --> 00:19:43,783
Your expression

365
00:19:44,143 --> 00:19:45,933
will make people think I intoxicated you.

366
00:19:48,303 --> 00:19:49,823
I didn't know you could cook.

367
00:19:50,783 --> 00:19:52,343
Is there anything I can't do?

368
00:19:53,103 --> 00:19:54,063
Aren't there a lot?

369
00:19:54,173 --> 00:19:54,823
Such as?

370
00:19:55,623 --> 00:19:56,343
Such as

371

I'll eat later.

375
00:20:25,973 --> 00:20:27,453
It's a little weird

376
00:20:27,863 --> 00:20:29,023
for you to stare at me while I eat.

I can't find the poker cards.

590

Look for them yourself.

591

Okay, I'll get them for you later.

It's too noisy here.

He's killing his way back!

Aren't we supposed to watch movies and play cards at home?

Anyway, I haven't been home for a long time

Good!

618
00:36:18,063 --> 00:36:19,693
But I can't go home too late.

Dian,

620
00:36:22,943 --> 00:36:23,773
something's wrong with you.

621

Are you afraid of Sang Yan?

622
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:27,253
What does it have to do with Sang Yan?

623
00:36:27,773 --> 00:36:29,943
One thing in the joint rent agreement

00:36:29,943 --> 00:36:30,943
between Dian and Sang Yan

625
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,583
is both of them can't take friends home for fun.

626
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:33,773
And they can't go home too late.

627

Don't be so exaggerate.

Is Sang Yan

629
00:36:38,543 --> 00:36:40,063
usually very fierce to you?

630
00:36:40,173 --> 00:36:41,423
Why do I feel you fear him?

631
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:43,463
No, don't listen to Qiao's overstatement.

I'll tell you in advance next time.

757
00:42:00,293 --> 00:42:00,943
Next time?

758
00:42:04,373 --> 00:42:06,253
Do you want to punish me?

759
00:42:10,253 --> 00:42:11,143
Okay, punishment.

760
00:42:12,373 --> 00:42:13,653
So what will be the punishment?

761
00:42:17,813 --> 00:42:18,733
I don't know.

762
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:21,213
It's up to you.

763
00:42:23,293 --> 00:42:24,583
If it's up to me,

764
00:42:24,733 --> 00:42:25,693
then...

765
00:42:30,903 --> 00:42:31,543
Exchange.

766
00:42:32,213 --> 00:42:33,213
Exchange for what?

767
00:42:35,583 --> 00:42:36,333
Tomorrow,

768
00:42:36,543 --> 00:42:38,653
I'll take someone home for dinner too.

769
00:42:48,103 --> 00:42:49,143
Do you have a girlfriend?

770
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,773
I mean

771
00:42:53,773 --> 00:42:54,983
you should tell your girlfriend

772
00:42:55,003 --> 00:42:56,543
about our joint rent

773
00:42:56,543 --> 00:42:57,623
if you have one

774
00:42:57,623 --> 00:42:58,813
in case of misunderstandings.

775
00:42:59,983 --> 00:43:00,813
I don't have a girlfriend.

776
00:43:01,293 --> 00:43:02,063
But

777
00:43:02,063 --> 00:43:03,333
don't be too happy about it.

778
00:43:03,733 --> 00:43:04,733
I don't want one.

779
00:43:06,903 --> 00:43:07,543
Okay.

780
00:43:08,063 --> 00:43:09,583
So we'll talk about it

781
00:43:09,583 --> 00:43:10,813
if you find a girlfriend

782
00:43:10,813 --> 00:43:11,623
during our joint rent.

783
00:43:13,423 --> 00:43:14,253
And of course,

784
00:43:14,253 --> 00:43:16,333
I will tell you if I have a boyfriend.

785
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:17,023
Not interested.

786
00:43:22,373 --> 00:43:23,773
Who is he going to bring back home?

Dad,

792
00:43:54,103 --> 00:43:55,653
I think something's wrong

793
00:43:55,853 --> 00:43:56,503
with my brother.

794
00:43:57,943 --> 00:43:58,813
Your brother...

795
00:43:58,943 --> 00:43:59,693
Let's toast!

796
00:44:03,853 --> 00:44:04,373
Well, next...

797
00:44:04,373 --> 00:44:05,503
I have things to do. I'm going out.

798

Where are you going on the Spring Festival Eve?

799
00:44:08,253 --> 00:44:09,063
To meet a friend.

800
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:09,773
What friend?

801
00:44:09,773 --> 00:44:10,813
Is it Jiaxu?

802
00:44:12,373 --> 00:44:13,903
Meet him tomorrow even if you have to.

Come on, Ping.

805

It's the Spring Festival Eve.

806
00:44:20,503 --> 00:44:21,293
It's fine.

807
00:44:21,423 --> 00:44:22,653
It's because you spoiled him.

808
00:44:25,903 --> 00:44:26,903
Why are you back?

809
00:44:27,903 --> 00:44:30,293
Didn't you said you wouldn't be back until the eighth day of Spring Festival?

810
00:44:31,023 --> 00:44:32,543
