1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,340
I'm self-willed and act like a baby to make you angry,

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,820
but you always stay so calm.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,340
Until you are beaten by my loveliness,

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,900
I will consider leaving the solar system.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,620
The universe has gravitation, has gravitation,

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,060
and you have a fatal attraction to me.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,540
Even the path of half of the universe

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,220
can't stop me.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,660
I have the sadness of being homeless,

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,300
while you have the warmth like the sun.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,740
I've been through tens of millions of light-years

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,940
just to be loved by you.

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,980
I am the love of the moon following the planet.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,580
You are the charming danger of flying over the asteroid belt.

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,900
I've wandered for tens of millions of light-years

16
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,060
just to be found by you and to be remembered forever.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,580
My Girlfriend is an Alien

18
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,020
Episode 24

19
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,040
The time limit of one week is about to expire.

20
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,040
You didn't come to me after so long a time.

21
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,880
Do you really want to resign?

22
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,240
You got it wrong.

23
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,000
This is my own problem.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,200
I will solve it by myself.

25
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,720
Saying this,

26
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,160
you must have figured out a way,

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,720
Not yet.

28
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,280
But I have come up with some thoughts.

29
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,720
If things can progress quickly...

30
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,120
So you don't have a solution.

31
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,040
Fang Leng,

32
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,800
get married with Jiang Xue, will you?

33
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,920
Under the current circumstances,

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,840
with our own strength,

35
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,920
we can't reverse the situation.

36
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,560
Only when we form an alliance with Xue,

37
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,120
can we secure your position.

38
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,280
I know the people in the company very well.

39
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,400
In all the past years,

40
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,840
though they haven't said anything,

41
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,440
they

42
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,080
have had issues with your holding the post

43
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,160
of President of the company at such a young age.

44
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,880
Now,

45
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,960
it is so lucky for them to have this chance.

46
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,400
They will definitely figure out a way to kick you out.

47
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,400
Therefore,

48
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,920
only Xue

49
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,680
can pull you out of the mire.

50
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,920
If I want to remain in the mire, what will you do?

51
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,160
Dad,

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,640
till now, you haven't got it clear

53
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,960
why I have got into such a plight.

54
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,360
It is not because my illness was exposed,

55
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,920
and not because the others objected to me,

56
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,920
but because I am a sick person for real

57
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,800
and something is wrong with me.

58
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,560
It is normal for me to be questioned by the others.

59
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,480
However, I want to stay to prove myself.

60
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,120
I want to prove that

61
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,120
a sick person

62
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,000
can also manage a company well.

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,320
This is the right way, isn't it?

64
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,360
In my opinion, your thoughts

65
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,760
are too naive.

66
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,680
My amnesia

67
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,200
is like a blemish of me.

68
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,880
I have been concealing it

69
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,080
all the time.

70
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,880
But finally it was found out.

71
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,720
When everyone waited to see

72
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,120
how I would cover up

73
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,040
this problem of me,

74
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,160
there was only one person

75
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,680
who said that everyone would lose memories,

76
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,360
and I only lost more memories than the others.

77
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,320
On that day,

78
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,400
I began to feel

79
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,040
that it is not a blemish at all.

80
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,640
You don't want to marry Jiang Xue

81
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,680
not only because you want to prove yourself, right?

82
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,680
There is another reason known to you.

83
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,760
I love another girl...

84
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,560
Enough!

85
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,800
It is OK that you don't love Jiang Xue.

86
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,920
But you can't

87
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,560
put our family behind yourself.

88
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,360
So do you mean that

89
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,440
you want me to

90
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,320
make a choice between our Fang family and Xiaoqi?

91
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,120
Fang Leng,

92
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,400
you can take it that I, as your dad,

93
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,240
am begging you.

94
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,680
Mom.

95
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,880
What are you doing?

96
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,440
You scared me.

97
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,120
Why did come you back so early?

98
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,600
Because I missed you

99
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
and couldn't concentrate on work.

100
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,440
Where is dad?

101
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,840
He is having a talk with Fang Leng inside.

102
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,600
What is the talk about?

103
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,240
Let's go talk in your room.

104
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,400
Go! Go! Go!

105
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,640
Well, what is the matter?

106
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,800
Let's go.

107
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,040
What?

108
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,880
All people have their own fates.

109
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,480
Fang Leng just abandons the broad road

110
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,760
and chooses to walk on the one-plank bridge
with Chai Xiaoqi.

111
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,680
This isn't good.

112
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,440
I have to persuade my dad.

113
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,720
You can do nothing about it.

114
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,160
Even if we join hands,

115
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,360
we are no better than Fang Leng.

116
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,960
Even Fang Leng can do nothing about it.

117
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,160
What can you do?

118
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,680
What if Leng insists in not marrying Jiang Xue

119
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,120
and is beside himself with rage.

120
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
Then it will suit him well.

121
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,920
I didn't mean that.

122
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,920
I mean that he will get what he wants.

123
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,080
It is fine as long as Fang Leng think it is OK.

124
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,120
You want to put in a word.

125
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,280
How can you do that?

126
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,560
You want to make Chai Xiaoqi

127
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,520
daughter-in-law of our family.

128
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,280
But could that be possible?

129
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,000
Why isn't it possible?

130
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,480
As long as she is not married with Leng,
it will be fine.

131
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,480
What did you say?

132
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,280
Nothing, mom.

133
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,240
Please leave.

134
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,640
I am perturbed in mind.

135
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,280
Didn't you say you missed me?

136
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,400
I will stay with you a little longer.

137
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:14,780
Please leave now.

138
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,520
Why?

139
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,560
You are back.

140
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,320
Hmm.

141
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,600
I have sorted out all materials.

142
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,640
Have a look!

143
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,360
I also prepared

144
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,160
questionnaires about the perfume preferences.

145
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,240
Tomorrow we can conduct relevant research together.

146
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,400
What is wrong with you?

147
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,000
Were you scolded by your dad?

148
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,360
No, I wasn't.

149
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,440
My dad was worried about me.

150
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,040
So he called me over to have a talk.

151
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,400
That's quite good.

152
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,840
Xiaoqi.

153
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,240
Mm.

154
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,000
About this project,

155
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,680
I still have a lot of things to think about.

156
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,000
You may leave first.

157
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,720
Aren't you in a hurry?

158
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,520
It doesn't matter.

159
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,720
I can accompany you to work overtime.

160
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,280
You need not.

161
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:43,600
You.

162
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,200
You have done a lot for me.

163
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:49,880
For the next.

164
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,000
it is time for me to make a good choice.

165
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:56,840
Just go back.

166
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,160
Just go.

167
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,000
Then I am off.

168
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:19,920
Good night!

169
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,640
Good night!

170
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,360
Assistant Han.

171
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,240
Why are you here?

172
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,680
Xiaoqi,

173
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,960
let's elope, shall we?

174
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,440
Are you crazy?

175
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,160
Why shall we elope?

176
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,840
It makes no sense.

177
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,080
Don't you want to help Leng?

178
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,720
What do you mean?

179
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,640
My dad

180
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,920
wants me to take the place of Leng.

181
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,320
If I leave,

182
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,880
my dad will be left with no choice.

183
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,200
He can only turn to Leng.

184
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,480
Thus, if we elope,

185
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,520
it will be of great help for him.

186
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,320
Oh.

187
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,880
Do you mean that

188
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,680
you want to help Fang Leng very much?

189
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,240
Yes.

190
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,640
For you,

191
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,080
is the brotherhood between you and your Leng

192
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,520
really very important?

193
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,760
Of course.

194
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:44,840
Hmm.

195
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,040
Then you can leave alone.

196
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,240
Why do you get me involved?

197
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,680
Because in my heart, you are more important than him.

198
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,400
As long as you are with me,

199
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,640
I can give up everything.

200
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,120
Whether it is the family

201
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,400
or work,

202
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,480
I can abandon them all.

203
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,760
But if you are together with Leng...

204
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,400
What if I am together with your Leng?

205
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,720
Mr. Fang.

206
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,080
From now on,

207
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,600
all work in the charge of me shall be suspended.

208
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,520
Why?

209
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,160
Isn't there

210
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,160
any other solution to address the crisis?

211
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,360
You won't be together with him.

212
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,200
Even if you want to be together with him,

213
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,600
he won't choose you.

214
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,280
Why?

215
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,480
Because he is different from me.

216
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,440
I can be childish.

217
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,880
I can be wayward.

218
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,440
But he can't.

219
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,680
He can give up his career for you,

220
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,440
but he can never abandon our Fang family and dad for you.

221
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
Therefore, Xiaoqi,

222
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,880
please agree to

223
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,360
leave with me.

224
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,720
As long as we leave,

225
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,360
Leng won't have a hard time making choices.

226
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,800
What did you say?

227
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,840
If I stay here,

228
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,480
Fang Leng won't be able to deal with the crisis?

229
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,320
As long as I give up on Xiaoqi,

230
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,320
I can resolve all crises.

231
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,840
Anyway,

232
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,400
time is running out.

233
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,720
You only need to leave with me.

234
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,600
We can come back later if you want.

235
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,200
OK.

236
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,280
I believe you.

237
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,400
No matter what the reason is,

238
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,880
even if my departure can help Fang Leng,

239
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,280
I won't leave him.

240
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,320
But I won't give up.

241
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,120
You are Fang Leng's younger brother.

242
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,960
Why don't you know him?

243
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,520
You have followed me for a long time.

244
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,560
You should know me well.

245
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,480
In my eyes,

246
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,760
Fang Leng is calm

247
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,720
and strong.

248
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,640
Even if he is thrown down into the dirt by others,

249
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,680
he would stand up again.

250
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,440
Since childhood,

251
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,880
I have never admitted defeat to anyone.

252
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,120
When he gets into trouble,

253
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
he will never resort to others for help.

254
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,880
Because it is harder for him

255
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,000
to do that than to fail.

256
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,520
If I have to betray my feelings to keep my career,

257
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,760
that will be a greater humiliation for me than failure.

258
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,520
Therefore,

259
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,000
I won't sacrifice myself

260
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,440
to help him secure his career.

261
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,240
Therefore, I won't sacrifice Xiaoqi

262
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,640
in exchange for the success of my career.

263
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,080
You said you would work for me.

264
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,520
Why are you standing here on the curbside?

265
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,680
Why are you here?

266
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,400
I have solved all problems.

267
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,760
For the next, of course I will come to you.

268
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,600
Why do you

269
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,680
come to me?

270
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,000
Of course, I have come to you for your help.

271
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:43,840
Let's go.

272
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,640
Wait a moment.

273
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,280
As you said,

274
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,200
you have conducted the survey for me.

275
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,160
Don't laugh at me.

276
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,600
I know that

277
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,800
the project survey

278
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,280
should be conducted at the very beginning.

279
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,880
It is of use for me to do anything now.

280
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,760
If I really do nothing,

281
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,840
there will be no hope at all.

282
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,720
Who said it would of no use?

283
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,000
These answers

284
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,080
may give us a lot of inspirations.

285
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,320
Let me have a look.

286
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,700
=Questionnaire about the Perfume Preference=

287
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,760
Stop flipping it.

288
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
Standing there for a long time,

289
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,200
I only completed a few questionnaires.

290
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,640
It doesn't matter.

291
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,440
These questionnaires may provide the best answers
even if there are only a few of them.

292
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,840
The answers in all of them are the same.

293
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,240
Speaking of perfume,

294
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,520
they just want to use it to attract the persons they love.

295
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,240
We'd better read the previous materials.

296
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,200
We may find some good ideas.

297
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,320
Wait a minute.

298
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,600
If all the answers are the same...

299
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,680
You said that they use perfume to

300
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,120
to attract the others, right?

301
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,320
Yes.

302
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,160
The perfume is just like the hormone of humans.

303
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,360
Hormone?

304
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:07,760
Yes.

305
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,640
When I just arrived here,

306
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,240
I couldn't resist the hormone

307
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,760
given off by men at all.

308
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,400
As long as I pick up the scent,

309
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,840
within three minutes,

310
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,080
I will be like a drunken person.

311
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,760
Right.

312
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,840
Three minutes!

313
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,600
Within three minutes,

314
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,840
one person will be made intoxicated

315
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,000
and fall in love with the other person.

316
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,960
Three minutes later,

317
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,000
when the smell of the perfume fades away,

318
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,320
the person will regain sanity.

319
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,200
However, the other person got a chance because of this.

320
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,280
It is a chance of falling in love.

321
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,000
Don't you think this is an excellent scheme?

322
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,920
Oh.

323
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,280
Of course.

324
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,240
But it is impossible for our company

325
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,640
to create such wonderful perfume.

326
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,360
Who said that?

327
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,040
It is a piece of cake for me.

328
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,200
Let's get started?

329
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,880
Where should we start?

330
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,880
Xiaoqi.

331
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,160
Xiaoqi.

332
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,400
Get your things

333
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,880
and go sleep in the bedroom.

334
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,440
Have you done all your work?

335
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,560
How about you?

336
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,800
These are the ingredients I preliminarily prepared.

337
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,960
However, I haven't

338
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,000
asked the lab personnel to test them.

339
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,680
So the effects are still unknown.

340
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,880
It only took a week to do this.

341
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,800
It can be said to be a miracle.

342
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,680
I will go to the company with the scheme first.

343
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,400
After I convince them,

344
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,080
we will go on with the next step in the lab.

345
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,760
Hmm.

346
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,000
Xiaoqi,

347
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,600
when I release the news,

348
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,960
I hope you can be present.

349
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,360
After all, you helped me

350
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,560
finish this scheme.

351
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,360
No matter how things turn out,

352
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,720
I hope you can be by my side.

353
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,960
I mean,

354
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,480
in the event that we can't convince them,
what should we do?

355
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,600
Then I will live off you.

356
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,720
Get prepared

357
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,240
to be responsible for me.

358
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,120
You bad guy!

359
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,080
Then I will go back to the restaurant now.

360
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,480
I will straighten out things.

361
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,880
I will go to join you in the company after I am done.

362
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,360
OK!

363
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,120
Naughty!

364
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,200
Miss Chai,

365
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,640
it has been a long time.

366
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:10,640
It is you!

367
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,040
What do you want?

368
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,160
Don't get nervous.

369
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,720
To meet you,

370
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,560
I have waited here for the whole night.

371
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,080
I have nothing to say with you.

372
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,680
Don't you fear

373
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,880
I will disclose your secret

374
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,240
and let Mr. Fang know you are a monster?

375
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,440
What did you say?

376
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,520
I didn't follow you.

377
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,800
Actually,

378
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,720
I don't want to give you a hard time.

379
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,240
As long as you tell me your identity,

380
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,680
I promise

381
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,080
no one will know your secret.

382
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,600
How about you?

383
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,120
What is your purpose?

384
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,120
So you really don't know?

385
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,200
Why is Fang Leng here?

386
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,240
Where is your wound?

387
00:19:59,240 --> 00:19:59,720
Don't touch me!

388
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,240
Where is your wound?

389
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:00,720
Don't touch me!

390
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,760
Get your hands off me! Don't touch me!

391
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,200
Where is your wound?

392
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:02,880
Let go of me!

393
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,520
You!

394
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:11,880
You!

395
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,720
What is the matter with you?

396
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,160
You are right.

397
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,760
I am a monster indeed.

398
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,840
If you dare to threaten me again,

399
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,960
I can kill you now.

400
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,800
Do you think I am afraid of you?

401
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,840
Why are you here?

402
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,480
If my memory didn't lie to me,

403
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,440
today is supposed to

404
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,680
the day when you hold the lunch press conference?

405
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,800
How you figured out what to do?

406
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,040
Of course.

407
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,840
Thank you for your care, Miss Jiang!

408
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,040
Wait up!

409
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,040
Uncle Fang should have told you, didn't he?

410
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,040
I want to help you sincerely.

411
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,480
If you are talking about our marriage,

412
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,600
I can give you my answer now.

413
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,640
Jiang Xue,

414
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,560
please stop selling yourself as goods.

415
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,680
You have gone so far.

416
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,560
You have made all efforts.

417
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,960
Instead of me,

418
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,080
the person you should care about

419
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,480
is yourself.

420
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,760
What do you mean?

421
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,240
Look at you!

422
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,200
You are smart,

423
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,280
and independent.

424
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,200
You have your own career.

425
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,440
The most important thing for you now

426
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,000
is to find a person

427
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,440
who loves you wholeheartedly.

428
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,360
Isn't this what you really want?

429
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,360
Don't have your hands tied with me?

430
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,720
Let go of me.

431
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,240
Then you can walk out of the dilemma for real.

432
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,320
I believe in the days to come,

433
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,720
you will find real happiness.

434
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,640
Thank you for loving me once.

435
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,960
The managerial personnel and journalists are all here.

436
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,480
OK.

437
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,760
Mr. Fang will arrive in a moment.

438
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,000
Mr. Fang.

439
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,680
Mr. Fang.

440
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,640
Has Xiaoqi arrived?

441
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,440
Isn't she with you?

442
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,200
Call her.

443
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,720
Nobody answered the phone.

444
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,120
Might anything have happened to her?

445
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,680
The launch press conference is about to start right away.

446
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,520
Send someone to go to the restaurant to pick her up.

447
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,800
Ask her to come in a hurry.

448
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,040
Yes.

449
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,560
Where is this place?

450
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,000
You came round?

451
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,080
Come on.

452
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,600
Let me untie you.

453
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,760
Sorry.

454
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,480
I cut the wrong place.

455
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,000
However,

456
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,240
this is not supposed to be the blood of the earthlings.

457
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,160
Could I saw wrongly again?

458
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,480
You have discovered this last time,

459
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:01,960
haven't you?

460
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:04,800
Say it.

461
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,440
Who are you on earth?

462
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,040
If I tell you,

463
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,200
will you let me go?

464
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,040
That's the condition I proposed last time.

465
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,600
It is a different case now.

466
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,440
Whether I will let you go or not

467
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,760
depends on my mood.

468
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,200
You!

469
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,080
Miss Chai,

470
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,560
you are in my hands now.

471
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,520
Even if you don't tell me,

472
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,480
I will find it out with my ability.

473
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,400
Nonetheless,

474
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,680
you are such a great

475
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,880
experimental article.

476
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,160
It will be a great waste if I don't experiment on you.

477
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,440
Ah.

478
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,760
You must hurry.

479
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,440
What do you mean?

480
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,800
Haven't you found that

481
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,280
my body temperature has begun to fall?

482
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,200
If you don't hurry up,

483
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,440
I may die.

484
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,560
By then,

485
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,440
your experimental article will be useless for sure.

486
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,520
You lied to me.

487
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,280
I just cut you lightly once.

488
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,600
Why will you die?

489
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,600
It has nothing to do with your cut.

490
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,400
It is because you touched my hand.

491
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,320
My skin

492
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,120
can't come into direct contact with the earthling.

493
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,360
You said I am an earthling.

494
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,400
So you are

495
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,640
really an alien?

496
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,400
Why need I joke with you

497
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,480
at the cost of my life?

498
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,040
If you want to save my life,

499
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,640
you should hurry to warm me up.

500
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,760
I won't be taken in by you.

501
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,320
You want to send me away.

502
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,920
Then you can take the chance to escape, right?

503
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,080
If I had been able to escape,

504
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,680
I would have killed you.

505
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,120
Why should I remain here being tortured by you?

506
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,360
Then behave yourself!

507
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,720
Chai Xiaoqi!

508
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:35,840
Chai Xiaoqi!

509
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,600
Chai Xiaoqi!

510
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,040
OK!

511
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,160
I got it.

512
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:16,840
What is the matter?

513
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,440
Xiaoqi didn't go back to the restaurant at all.

514
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,000
Ms. Chai and Fang Lie also said they didn't see her.

515
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,640
It is really unknown where she has gone.

516
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,400
Shall I send people to look for her?

517
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,920
It is time for the launch press conference.

518
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,120
You'd better go first.

519
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,160
Something is wrong.

520
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,840
She agreed to meet me in the company today.

521
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,760
It is such an important conference.

522
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,160
It is impossible for her to stand me up.

523
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,760
Notify the Scientific Research Department

524
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,480
to locate the positioning of her mobile phone.

525
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,360
I must know where she is.

526
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:42,680
Hmm.

527
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,120
Why is Xiaoqi missing?

528
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,600
Miss Chai.

529
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,680
Chai Xiaoqi!

530
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,440
Chai Xiaoqi!

531
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,920
Chai Xiaoqi, wake up!

532
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,240
If you don't wake up,

533
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,520
I will get you wounded again.

534
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,480
This,

535
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,920
this is the sapphire.

536
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,160
No wonder

537
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,120
she tried to steal it.

538
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,960
I will see,

539
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,560
I will see what other secrets you have.

540
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,840
What are you doing?

541
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,440
Don't inject the strange liquid

542
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,880
into my body.

543
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,200
Don't be afraid.

544
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,880
I am

545
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,440
just

546
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,040
doing this to make you coordinate with my research.

547
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,600
My research.

548
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,160
Hmm.

549
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,440
Mm.

550
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,400
Hmm.

551
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,520
How is it?

552
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,280
Her positioning has been locked.

553
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,040
It is in a remote factory in the suburbs.

554
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,080
Why did she go to the factory?

555
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,120
The reason is unknown.

556
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,600
It is unclear how she is now.

557
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,040
We can't call the police arbitrarily.

558
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,080
Mr. Fang,

559
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,680
for the next,

560
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,640
what should we do?

561
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,080
It is impossible for her to go to such a faraway place.

562
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,880
Even if she goes there,

563
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,800
she will contact me first to let me know it.

564
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,720
What do you mean?

565
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,040
Has Xiaoqi been abducted by someone?

566
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,760
However,

567
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,040
it is really possible based on her personality.

568
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,240
Let's find her first.

569
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,360
-Leng, wait up! -Mr. Fang.

570
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,040
I will go find her.

571
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,040
You will be done if you are absent from
the launch press conference.

572
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:32,720
No, I must go.

573
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,760
I have a hunch that

574
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,760
she must have gone into trouble.

575
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,400
Notify everyone that the launch press conference
will be postponed.

576
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,440
I must find Xiaoqi first.

577
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:38,800
Mr. Fang.

578
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,440
I will entrust everything to you.

579
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:45,900
=Roundabout=

580
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,520
Leng, on the right ahead.

581
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,700
=Roundabout=

582
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,440
Turn left ahead.

583
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,120
We are almost there.

584
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,360
Xiaoqi!

585
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,200
Xiaoqi!

586
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,520
Xiaoqi!

587
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,600
Xiaoqi!

588
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,120
Are you all right?

589
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,160
I can't die.

590
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,960
I can't die.

591
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,800
I have to see Fang Leng

592
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,760
make a success.

593
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,200
I have promised him.

594
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,400
I am sorry.

595
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,400
I will break my promise.

596
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,280
I am here. Don't worry.

597
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,000
It's all right now.

598
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,160
Sorry!

599
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,560
Really.

600
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,880
Fang Leng, I am sorry!

601
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,520
I am

602
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,320
sorry!

603
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,360
Go.

604
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,040
Let's go over there.

605
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,280
Is she there?

606
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:46,920
No.

607
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,320
This way.

608
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,440
Fang Leng.

609
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,480
Fang Leng.

610
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,600
Xiaoqi.

611
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,680
Fang Leng.

612
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,640
Fang Leng.

613
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,520
Fang Leng.

614
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,000
Xiaoqi.

615
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,200
Xiaoqi, are you all right?

616
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,560
You will be all right.

617
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,040
I won't allow anything to happen to you.

618
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:21,220
Ever since I met you,

619
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,900
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

620
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,300
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

621
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,180
only you.

622
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,380
We're out of reach

623
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,700
but appreciate each other.

624
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:45,500
I keep going and run into your track somehow.

625
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,540
The yearning invades

626
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:52,100
and lurks in my mind.

627
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:59,660
The more I want to escape, the more
I am pulled by it bearing pains.

628
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:03,740
I'm getting addicted to it

629
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:07,060
and my sense is shielded.

630
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:13,860
There is no trace of the reason for this moment.

631
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:17,020
Put the hottest heart

632
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:20,340
in this cold body.

633
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,700
I'm looking at you,

634
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:27,860
and my love has nowhere to go.

635
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,100
Ever since I met you,

636
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:35,020
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

637
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,300
Every day is a new memory

638
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:41,340
which is only be about you and me.

639
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,580
I can't lie to myself anymore.

640
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:48,420
Please give me the courage to believe.

641
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:51,340
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

642
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:54,260
only you.

643
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:59,380
Even everything becomes silent,

644
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,500
I still have you.
