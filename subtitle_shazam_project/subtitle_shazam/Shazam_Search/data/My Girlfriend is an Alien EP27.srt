My Girlfriend is an Alien

3
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Oh my God!

4
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,600
Why am I here?

5
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,720
Your smell...

6
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,440
Do you like me?

7
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,480
Yes.

8
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,920
Since when?

9
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,000
Since the first time I met you.

10
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,760
You were hurt.

11
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,640
So I treated you in my spaceship.

12
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,000
I was thinking

13
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,600
you'd better be single.

14
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,440
Then

15
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,560
I could take you home.

16
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,080
But,

17
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,560
if you had loved one,

18
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,480
I would probably be very sad.

19
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,480
But I'd still like you.

20
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,400
Very good.

21
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,200
What's good?

22
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,240
The hormone perfume is perfect for interrogation.

23
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,720
You're almost spilled out how old your mom is.

24
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,440
Is it talking?

25
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,200
Hah.

26
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,160
Yea,

27
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,280
It is threatening you.

28
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,080
Can you introduce it to me?

29
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,080
It's called Xiaobu,

30
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,160
my personal secretary

31
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,880
and A.I. in my home planet.

32
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,320
But on the earth,

33
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,120
it's just a normal turtle.

34
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,160
I'm done.

35
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,520
I'm exposed too.

36
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,480
All because of you, a nasty human!

37
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,390
So you will also become a normal earthling in the future?

38
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,400
There's no future for me.

39
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,800
What is wrong?

40
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,080
What do you mean by "no future"?

41
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,840
My energy is running out.

42
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,360
After this dance with you,

43
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,960
I don't know if I

44
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,080
could still stand tomorrow.

45
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,840
Is it because of the annunciator?

46
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,480
Now, the Three Minutes Love Ball is over.

47
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,920
Though the magic of love lasts for only three minutes,

48
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,760
a happy life shall be acquired on your own.

49
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,800
Come on, everyone. Let's keep the mood high.

50
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,960
Goodness!

51
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,000
What did I say?

52
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,520
Xiaoqi.

53
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,360
Should this annunciator be taken out?

54
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,600
No, no, no.

55
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,480
You can't do that.

56
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,360
It's too dangerous.

57
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,000
Dangerous?

58
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:06,920
Why do you know?

59
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,560
Stop questioning me.

60
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,280
Xiaoqi.

61
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,480
Never ever can you do that.

62
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,280
If you do that,

63
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,240
I'll hate you forever.

64
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,920
Xiaoqi.

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,520
Xiaoqi.

66
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,320
Xiaoqi didn't go this way, did she?

67
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,600
We're not going for her,

68
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,670
but for the annunciator that can bring her home.

69
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,280
You've made her talk!

70
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,120
Oh my God.

71
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,880
The hormone perfume is amazing.

72
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,040
When people are in love,

73
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,600
there's full of beautiful lies

74
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,880
and absolute loyalty.

75
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,760
Take it easy.

76
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,360
If anything happens to us,

77
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,880
there will be none to help Xiaoqi find that thing.

78
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,000
No need for finding.

79
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,120
The annunciator is just in my heart.

80
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,800
Wait. Brother.

81
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,600
You can't be gonna open your chest to take it out, can you?

82
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,400
Brother.

83
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,480
Brother. You can't do that!

84
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,720
Brother!

85
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:19,920
Doctor.

86
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,480
Is it really irremovable?

87
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,600
No.

88
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,840
It has been a miracle that

89
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,080
the foreign matter doesn't kill you.

90
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,640
Taking it out by force is too risk.

91
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,160
Even if our best Professor Gao comes to perform the surgery,

92
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,120
the success rate will be lower than thirty percent.

93
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,960
What if I just want the thirty percent?

94
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,960
Brother, are you crazy?

95
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,840
Do you understand what thirty percent means?

96
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,600
You have a death wish?

97
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,640
Your younger brother is rather rational.

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,320
Please do persuade him.

99
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,680
Doctor.

100
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,720
Brother.

101
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,840
For a long time,

102
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,480
you're the one who do the lecture.

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,560
And I don't want to say something profound.

104
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,560
Just think about our dad,

105
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,720
and our family.

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,280
No way will I allow you to do that.

107
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,800
I owe my life to Xiaoqi in the first place.

108
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,000
I can't see Xiaoqi die, Fang Lie.

109
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,680
I don't want her to die either.

110
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,320
We can think up another way, can't we?

111
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,240
There's no time.

112
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,880
Do you know?

113
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,560
I saw Xiaoqi pass out.

114
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,880
She can barely stand up.

115
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,040
I won't give up this method.

116
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,080
Compared to having died in that car accident,

117
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,960
it has been worthwhile for me.

118
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,560
At least now,

119
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,080
I still have thirty percent of success rate.

120
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,200
I still may live again.

121
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,800
Isn't it Xiaoqi's pet?

122
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,560
What do you want?

123
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,040
You're trying to talk to me?

124
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,120
The...The turtle is intelligent!

125
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,920
Give me a second.

126
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,200
Brother.

127
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,320
Do you want Xiaobu to draw lots?

128
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,000
Can you stop making noise?

129
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,640
Don't scare it.

130
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,360
Brother.

131
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,440
It is not talking.

132
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,560
Xiaoqi maybe told a lie to you, didn't she?

133
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:38,960
Xiaobu.

134
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,640
Is there anything you need on the table?

135
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,760
If there has,

136
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,400
stretch your head.

137
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,640
If not, you can wag your tail.

138
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,960
Brother!

139
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:51,880
Oh my God!

140
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,280
It really can understand you!

141
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,160
Xiaobu,

142
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,120
how can I communicate with you?

143
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,200
Brother,

144
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,240
does it intend to type?

145
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,440
Oh.

146
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:17,860
= Don't move. =

147
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,280
Wow.

148
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,080
I must take a short video of this.

149
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,920
This is amazing!

150
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,640
Brother.

151
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,560
Ouch, ouch!

152
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,400
It hurts.

153
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
I've told you. Don't bother it.

154
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,240
OK.

155
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,280
Don't make noise, do you?

156
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,440
OK, OK, OK.

157
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,000
Look, Xiaobu also says it.

158
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,520
Don't do the surgery!

159
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,920
Don't do the surgery. You'll die!

160
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,400
It seems that our magic turtle

161
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,280
also has no way to deal with it.

162
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,560
We'd better go home and think about it calmly.

163
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,720
Let's go. Let's go.

164
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,840
I see.

165
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,920
I'll do the surgery right away.

166
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,880
Why?

167
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,640
Look.

168
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,240
Don't do the surgery.

169
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,880
You'll die.

170
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,160
Unless you take me into the operating room,

171
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,440
probably I can

172
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,600
use my planet's technology to help you.

173
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,120
Hoo.

174
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,840
Xiaoqi can only drink water now.

175
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,320
She has no more energy

176
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,840
to digest food on the earth.

177
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,040
Go help her.

178
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,000
Don't let her eat anything else.

179
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,680
Xiaobu.

180
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,800
Xiaobu.

181
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,280
Where have you been?

182
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,600
Xiaobu.

183
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,600
Xiaobu. Xiaobu.

184
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:39,920
Xiaobu.

185
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,240
Weird.

186
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,120
Where has it gone?

187
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,800
Stolen by someone?

188
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,800
But who could be interested in a turtle?

189
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,000
Oh, at his place!

190
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,080
Ow!

191
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,200
But I can't win him in a fight now.

192
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,160
And he has hormone perfume.

193
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,680
It's like walking into a trap

194
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,760
for me to go find him now.

195
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:06,920
Xiaoqi.

196
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,520
Time to eat.

197
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,400
Xiaoqi.

198
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,280
You haven't eaten for long.

199
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,800
Listen.

200
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,520
A person

201
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,040
can lose his memory,

202
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,240
and lose his love,

203
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,640
but he can't lose his appetite.

204
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,680
Do you know that?

205
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,880
Eat now.

206
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,160
Ms. Chai.

207
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,120
I don't have no appetite now.

208
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,320
I've brought it up to you.

209
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,720
Are you expecting me to feed you?

210
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,760
This sound is familiar.

211
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,520
It must be from a nice car.

212
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,160
Is it that Mr. Fang come to meet you?

213
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,120
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

214
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,720
Don't eat now.

215
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:45,960
Come with me.

216
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,040
Ms. Chai.

217
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,040
Ms. Chai.

218
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,360
Where's Mr. Fang?

219
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:53,960
Why doesn't he come?

220
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,040
He's occupied.

221
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,240
He told me to bring something here.

222
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,440
Mr. Fang heard Xiaoqi is on a diet,

223
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,240
so he told me to bring some imported

224
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,400
nutrition drinks here.

225
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,400
After drinking this,

226
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,790
she will no longer need to have a meal.

227
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,880
How magical it is!

228
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,440
No more nutrition now.

229
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,560
Nutrition on the earth is hard to digest.

230
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,760
Drinking water is enough.

231
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,880
Xiaoqi.

232
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,640
Have a try.

233
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,680
Yea.

234
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,280
One taste may not be hurt.

235
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,480
This is not nutrition drink at all.

236
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,120
Just plain water.

237
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,000
Why does he suddenly

238
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,960
send me water?

239
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,680
How about it?

240
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,800
Delicious?

241
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,840
Not bad.

242
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,320
Really?

243
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,200
Let me try it too.

244
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,560
Sorry, Ms. Chai.

245
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,040
Mr. Fang

246
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,040
emphasized that

247
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,920
this is for Xiaoqi only.

248
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,640
No longer

249
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,280
should she eat anything else.

250
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,680
They have known something or what?

251
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,680
Alright.

252
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,880
The delivery has been done.

253
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:52,800
I gotta go.

254
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,320
Hold on. Hold on.

255
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,080
I...

256
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,600
Anything else, Miss Xiaoqi?

257
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,240
I have a pet.

258
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,360
That turtle I mean.

259
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,280
I accidentally left it in Mr. Fang's place.

260
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,640
Can you help me to retrieve it?

261
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,440
Mr. Fang is very fond of that pet lately.

262
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,120
After a couple of days,

263
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,800
Mr. Fang will bring it back to you himself.

264
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,720
Please be patient now.

265
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,240
Unreasonable.

266
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,560
How could he give some bottles of water

267
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,560
in exchange of my Xiaobu?

268
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,360
But how could he know I can only drink water now?

269
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,320
Because of Xiaobu?

270
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,920
But Xiaobu's talking frequency

271
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,640
can't be understood by earthlings.

272
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,640
Weird.

273
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,080
I've analyzed the surgery plan.

274
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,160
Mostly inadvisable.

275
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,360
I'll sign a liability waiver.

276
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,960
You're not concerned with any risks.

277
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,920
Mr. Fang.

278
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,560
I'm being responsible for you.

279
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,520
The shade on the CT

280
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,880
is really a fragment from the car accident.

281
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,440
We must be fully prepared before taking it out.

282
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,320
I can't wait.

283
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,360
If you really are unwilling to perform,

284
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,800
I can arrange other doctors for this.

285
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,880
Even I, the director of cardiology,

286
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,200
don't dare perform it easily,

287
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,440
who can be so irresponsible to perform it?

288
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,720
How about me?

289
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,240
Professor Gao.

290
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,400
Aren't you on a academic visit in the U.S.?

291
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,840
For someone's invitation,

292
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,600
I'm obliged.

293
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,320
Why do you come here?

294
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,840
Why can't I come?

295
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,760
Though I don't like you anymore,

296
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,480
as your friend,

297
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,280
I have to help you at the crucial moment.

298
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,280
Luckily,

299
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,280
I know uncle Gao who can help us.

300
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,320
After the success of surgery,

301
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,560
remember to treat me to dine.

302
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,800
Thank you in advance.

303
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,000
Mr. Fang.

304
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,520
Let's discuss the details of the surgery together.

305
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:41,920
OK.

306
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:42,920
Please.

307
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:43,880
Please.

308
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,120
Wait here.

309
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,640
This surgery is very dangerous.

310
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,000
I was thinking how to stop him.

311
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,780
Aren't you afraid anything would go wrong?

312
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,080
Of course.

313
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,960
After all, I used to love him.

314
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,640
I also want him to be safe and sound.

315
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,800
Then why do you...

316
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
Rest assured.

317
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,480
I've consulted with uncle Gao.

318
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,200
We won't force to take it out.

319
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,200
Besides, with Fang Leng's character,

320
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,560
his decision can't be reversed no matter what.

321
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,440
Determined as he is,

322
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,480
we should find someone worth trust.

323
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,400
I didn't expect you to be

324
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,760
so helpful at the crucial moment.

325
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,200
I'm quite charming when I am not

326
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,080
carried away by love.

327
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,040
= Xiaoqi =

328
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,080
Sorry, I have to go out.

329
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,760
My brother's surgery...

330
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,800
Rest assured.

331
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,480
I'll contact you if something happens.

332
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,000
Thanks.

333
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,840
Anything urgent?

334
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,200
Fang Lie.

335
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,640
Do you still take me as your friend?

336
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,040
Of course.

337
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,080
I swear I do.

338
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,200
Why do I feel

339
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,480
you've defected to your brother?

340
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,040
Took me to the bar out of no reason.

341
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,760
Well...

342
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,560
I didn't know he was there.

343
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,440
Never mind. Let's put it aside.

344
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,200
Have you seen my Xiaobu

345
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,240
around your brother?

346
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,200
That turtle?

347
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,720
Of course.

348
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,040
It was a killer.

349
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,000
Killer?

350
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,000
Oh.

351
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,200
It's cyberspeak.

352
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,520
It means Xiaobu is adorable.

353
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,160
Is he going to take my Xiaobu as hostage

354
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,080
and threaten me?

355
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,240
Of course not.

356
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,720
Since he remembered you,

357
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,360
he had come up with a big plan.

358
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,200
Plan for what?

359
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,280
I've deleted it

360
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,000
I never expected a returning back.

361
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,480
You

362
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,720
are only stubborn in speaking.

363
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,560
Wait.

364
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,520
Has he known I'm

365
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,400
an alien now?

366
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,080
I didn't say that.

367
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,760
It's the hormone perfume's fault.

368
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,360
God.

369
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,120
What on earth have I said to him?

370
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,280
Why do I recall nothing?

371
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,720
I have to see him in person.

372
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,040
Tell me where he is?

373
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,560
He...

374
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,800
Why are you looking away?

375
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,440
Seriously?

376
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,440
You're even going to deceive me?

377
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,760
You're my last good friend.

378
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,920
When people are in love,

379
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,760
there's full of beautiful lies,

380
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,960
and absolute loyalty.

381
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,080
Alright.

382
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,280
I won't lie.

383
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,320
Xiaoqi.

384
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,400
Doctor will play it by ear.

385
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,400
He won't take the annunciator forcibly.

386
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,000
Xiaoqi.

387
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,440
So my brother is right.

388
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,520
You're out of condition,

389
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,980
which makes the surgery more necessary.

390
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,160
Xiaobu is the one I'm worried about.

391
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,520
It always wanted to take the annunciator out before.

392
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,160
Now it offers to communicate with Fang Leng.

393
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,040
It must have planned it.

394
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,320
You mean

395
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,080
that turtle will harm my brother?

396
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,520
For saving me,

397
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,320
it's of high possibility that it will harm Fang Leng.

398
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,320
What are you two doing?

399
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,600
How long has he been in surgery?

400
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,480
How long that lasts?

401
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,800
Any problems here?

402
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
He's been there for quite a while.

403
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,160
Open up.

404
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,320
Open up. Open the door now!

405
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,360
Open up!

406
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,320
You've lost your mind, Xiaoqi?

407
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,160
Here is hospital!

408
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,520
Open up!

409
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,920
Xiaobu, don't harm Fang Leng.

410
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,320
Do you hear me?

411
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,600
Let's begin.

412
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,480
Xiaobu,

413
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,880
open the door!

414
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,800
Xiaoqi.

415
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,400
Xiaobu! Xiaobu!

416
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,320
Clam down.

417
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,000
Xiaobu.

418
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,320
If you can hear me,

419
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,360
don't be so willful, OK?

420
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,000
Xiaobu.

421
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,560
Xiaobu, please don't.

422
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,640
Xiaobu.

423
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,800
Xiaobu.

424
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,160
Xiaobu, please, don't be so willful,

425
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,120
ok?

426
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,880
Xiaobu, I beg you.

427
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,440
Open the door.

428
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,520
Xiaobu.

429
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,040
Xiaobu, please.

430
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,920
Open the door, Xiaobu.

431
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,840
You such a fool.

432
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,240
Just a little more to finish.

433
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,320
Xiaoqi.

434
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,480
Do you remember

435
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,400
the first time we arrived at the earth?

436
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,520
We came to this world

437
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,440
just to appreciate the sun on earth

438
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,680
and collect plants and fruits here

439
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,080
for our planet's species diversity.

440
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,840
If we got luck,

441
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,240
we might go to see the polar light.

442
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,600
Never did we expect a love story on the earth.

443
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,760
Look yourself now.

444
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,200
Crying and whining.

445
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,480
It'll be disgraceful if you go back home.

446
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,920
Do you think I'd given up like this?

447
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,120
No.

448
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,320
I must take the annunciator out

449
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,360
for you may go back home to disgrace yourself.

450
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,080
However,

451
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,600
I will try my best to protect him

452
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,000
even if sacrifice myself.

453
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,360
Xiaoqi, Let's go see the doctor.

454
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,760
Uncle Gao.

455
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,920
How is the surgery?

456
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,720
Who is Chai Xiaoqi?

457
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,480
I am.

458
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,160
This is what Mr. Fang asked me to give you.

459
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,840
He said you can go home now.

460
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,640
Go home?

461
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,080
This is...

462
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,640
Let me see him.

463
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,920
- I want to see him. - Xiaoqi.

464
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,840
Mr. Fang also said,

465
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,640
he didn't want to see you.

466
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,720
Is there anything wrong with him?

467
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,440
Please, doctor.

468
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,720
Just let me see him.

469
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,840
I beg you, please.

470
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,920
Just let me see him.

471
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,160
Can't you understand?

472
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,480
He asked you to leave.

473
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,800
He came to the hospital every time all because of you.

474
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,040
Is the slap last time

475
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,160
not enough to wake you up?

476
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,720
Take your thing and get lost now.

477
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,480
Jiang Xue,

478
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,640
don't do it too far.

479
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,240
My brother hasn't said anything.

480
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,200
Why are you so furious?

481
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,890
It's obvious from what he said, isn't it?

482
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,200
Asking her to leave.

483
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,040
Xiaobu.

484
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,640
Are you OK?

485
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,080
Fang Leng. He's alright.

486
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,200
Take it easy.

487
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,840
Let's go home.

488
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,120
Hold on!

489
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,960
We will go home.

490
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,240
You can get in now.

491
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,160
But,

492
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,120
don't make the patient emotional.

493
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,480
Eh.

494
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,000
Eh.

495
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,160
He should be fine now.

496
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,440
I shall go back.

497
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,280
Don't you want to see my brother?

498
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,040
No.

499
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,120
I said I'd give up him.

500
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,160
Besides,

501
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,280
I'm not the one he desires to see.

502
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,600
Why were you so arrogant just now when knowing that?

503
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,240
I didn't mean to pick on Xiaoqi.

504
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,840
I just want Fang Leng to get well soon.

505
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,040
Xiaoqi is his sickness.

506
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,920
He won't get well as long as she is here.

507
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,040
Some sickness can't be cured.

508
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,520
Or,

509
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,040
you wouldn't have come to help my brother.

510
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,520
Aren't you the same?

511
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,360
Wish we both could get well soon.

512
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,680
Brother, feeling better?

513
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,360
She's left?

514
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,080
Yes.

515
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,440
Don't you know

516
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,840
you almost died by that turtle?

517
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,760
Impossible.

518
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,120
What's impossible?

519
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,480
Xiaoqi has told me already.

520
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,280
That turtle has been wanting you dead for a long time.

521
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,800
I am still live and strong, am I not?

522
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,120
You're really making me angry.

523
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,040
Doing something totally crazily.

524
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,640
Stupid as Xiaoqi.

525
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,960
I could only trust it.

526
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,040
Though there's some twists

527
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,080
I eventually won the bet.

528
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,640
Yes, you won.

529
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,840
Xiaoqi also went home.

530
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,040
Happy now?

531
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,800
We will never see her again.

532
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,360
Brother, are you alright?

533
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,640
It's OK we won't see her.

534
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,640
At least I know

535
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,640
she's still alive somewhere.

536
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,920
Eat it now.

537
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,920
Your turtle body

538
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,760
favors this most, doesn't it?

539
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,160
I've spared half of my energy to you.

540
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,760
It's time for you to wake up.

541
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,400
Or I spare you the other half once more.

542
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,240
No.

543
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,600
You're awake.

544
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,840
Come out. Come out.

545
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,680
But

546
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,720
you have to promise me,

547
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,560
if I come out

548
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,680
you won't hit me.

549
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,080
I won't.

550
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,640
I even want to award you.

551
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,760
You helped me to retrieve the annunciator,

552
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,480
didn't you?

553
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,640
Come out.

554
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,560
I won't hit you.

555
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:28,840
OK?

556
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,200
You willful

557
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,480
deceitful

558
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,080
bad turtle.

559
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,960
You broke your promise.

560
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,560
Crafty as human.

561
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,520
Are you not?

562
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,240
You deceived him into performing the surgery.

563
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,640
You see,

564
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,200
we both learn how to deceive now.

565
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,920
We're both stained by this earth.

566
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,880
Press the annunciator now.

567
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,360
Everything will be fine when we get home.

568
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,920
If I press it,

569
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,640
can't we

570
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,400
go back the earth again?

571
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,400
We are doomed to not belong here.

572
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Don't you give up until our energy runs out?

573
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,280
But I haven't said

574
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,880
goodbye to him properly.

575
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,040
He even doesn't want to see you.

576
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,240
No need for goodbye now.

577
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:23,920
Just press it.

578
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,640
Press it.

579
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,560
The spaceship needs time to come here.

580
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:36,680
No.

581
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,640
I must see him for the last time.

582
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:54,760
Where is he?

583
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,760
Excuse me,

584
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,800
where is the patient here?

585
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:58,880
He's left.

586
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,880
Left?

587
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,160
He's alright now?

588
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,240
He's almost recovered.

589
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,560
Just few examinations need to do.

590
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,760
Our director tried to persuade him for several times.

591
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,880
But the patient insisted on leaving.

592
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,760
I heard his little brother say

593
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,280
he was trying to avoid somebody.

594
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,640
Avoid somebody?

595
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,000
When did he leave?

596
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,070
Just finished the procedures.

597
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,280
Probably still downstairs.

598
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,280
Fang Lie.

599
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,280
Open the door for me.

600
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,800
Fang Leng. Fang Lie.

601
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,080
- Open the door. Fang Lie. - Let's go.

602
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,480
Fang Lie.

603
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,120
Brother.

604
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,240
Fang Leng. Wait please.

605
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,280
Fang Lie.

606
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,080
Go.

607
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,760
Fang Lie, open the door.

608
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,800
Fang Lie.

609
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,760
Don't start the car.

610
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,560
Fang Lie! Fang Lie! Fang Leng!

611
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,560
Fang Lie.

612
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,880
Don't leave.

613
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,520
Fang Lie.

614
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,920
We treat her like this...

615
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,840
Isn't it a bit cruel?

616
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,720
If I remember correctly,

617
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,480
such speed can't get rid of her.

618
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,280
She can pause the time,

619
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,760
and even get into our car by light speed.

620
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,400
But look at her now.

621
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,760
She is not the Chai Xiaoqi she used to be.

622
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,560
I think

623
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,640
Xiaoqi is kinda miserable.

624
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,800
She can stop being like this

625
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,600
as long as she goes back.

626
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,800
She is concerned about you.

627
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,800
One of us has to

628
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,680
give up first.

629
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,320
Just let her hate me.

630
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,120
Brother.

631
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,080
Should I pick this or not?

632
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,320
Why not pick the phone?

633
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,200
What can you say to her?

634
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,680
You thought not picking

635
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,720
will solve the problem?

636
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,400
Brother,

637
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,960
Xiaoqi seems really pissed off by you.

638
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:31,840
Fang Leng.

639
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,600
At six p.m.,

640
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,790
I'll wait for you on the Renmin Bridge.

641
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,840
If you don't come,

642
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,990
I'll throw the annunciator into the river.

643
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:36,800
I mean it.

644
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:37,600
Hey.

645
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,160
Just reply her, can you?

646
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,960
If she really throws it,

647
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,280
everything will be ruined.

648
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,400
Leave it to me.

649
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,400
I have a plan.

650
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,440
Waiting for whom?

651
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,160
You bad guy.

652
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,640
I thought I had been deserted.

653
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,880
Why didn't reply me?

654
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,120
Why refused to see me?

655
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,120
If I hadn't threatened you with annunciator,

656
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,360
you'd still be avoiding me, right?

657
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,320
Come here.

658
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:27,960
I'm sorry.

659
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,840
Everything happened suddenly.

660
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,320
I still need some time.

661
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,120
So

662
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,320
what's the result of you consideration?

663
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,600
Respect our relationship.

664
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,360
What do you mean?

665
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,160
Cherish our time together.

666
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,160
Even if it's only one day left, I'll still cherish the day.

667
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,160
Even if it's only one second left,

668
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,080
I'll still cherish the second.

669
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,600
After all, in the rest of my life,

670
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,600
I won't open my chest

671
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,120
for another woman.

672
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,320
Still hurts?

673
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,480
No.

674
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:11,960
What about you?

675
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,200
What's your thought?

676
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:20,640
I...

677
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,120
won't leave.

678
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:25,880
Won't leave?

679
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,760
I mustn't return if I leave.

680
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,480
The outer space is in chaos recently.

681
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,680
It's hard to support the next space travel.

682
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,440
And my age is due.

683
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,520
The system will assign me a partner.

684
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,520
The law will force us to marry.

685
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,000
But you'll die if you stay.

686
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,880
Just die then.

687
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,760
Do you know?

688
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,760
I knew a kind of life on your earth,

689
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,400
It called mayfly.

690
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,520
They're born in every morning

691
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,200
and die before the sun sets.

692
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,320
Every part of their body

693
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,400
is totally designed for love.

694
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,400
Their mouth has degenerated

695
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,280
and full of bubbles in their stomach.

696
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,200
But,

697
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,000
to be suitable to fly lightly,

698
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,160
hungry as they are,

699
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,160
they only eat fluid food.

700
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,720
They have only one day to live.

701
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,280
During the day,

702
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,880
they have only one mission,

703
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,200
find a partner

704
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,840
to complete the mating.

705
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,800
After that,

706
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,600
they will die peacefully.

707
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,520
They are born for love

708
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,280
and end up with love.

709
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,360
Can I be your mayfly?

710
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,880
We'll always be together.

711
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:45,800
Ok?

712
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,160
Thanks for your understanding.

713
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,640
Thanks for letting us meet.

714
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,560
But now,

715
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,080
I don't need you anymore.

716
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,480
What are you doing?

717
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:10,840
I heard it from Xiaobu

718
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,880
that pressing will activate the annunciator.

719
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,150
Come on.

720
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,960
You lie to me!

721
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,560
I'd rather let you hate me

722
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,080
than see you die, Xiaoqi.

723
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,800
You despicable!

724
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,320
I am.

725
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,720
Cause I'm human.

726
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,440
Lying, being selfish.

727
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,200
These are all the nature of human.

728
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,040
To reach goals,

729
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,280
we can be regardless of anything.

730
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,480
I'm sorry.

731
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,800
But,

732
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,120
isn't love also the nature?

733
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,800
Do you really love me?

734
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,200
Is it that you loved me

735
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,160
because of the annunciator?

736
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,400
Now the annunciator has been taken out,

737
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,880
so you don't need me anymore.

738
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,040
Love has another name.

739
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,920
It's "do you a favor". Xiaoqi.

740
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:32,680
Do you remember

741
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,080
the first time I met you?

742
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,440
You said you were like a fairy

743
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,560
descending from the heaven.

744
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,960
In my heart,

745
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,280
you're always outgoing and reckless,

746
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,920
not fragile and feeble like now.

747
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,480
So I want you to go back to your planet.

748
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:54,840
You'll be

749
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,880
reborn there.

750
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,920
There's still some time before the spaceship arrives.

751
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,800
Before that,

752
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,440
can you

753
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,360
promise me one thing?

754
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,160
Say.

755
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,920
Look at me.

756
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:37,760
Look at me.

757
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,000
I want to reestablish the memory bank.

758
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,440
Let's

759
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,720
fall in love again.
