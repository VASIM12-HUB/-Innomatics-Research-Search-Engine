(Episode 9)

3
00:01:39,736 --> 00:01:40,545
Tian Zhen,

4
00:01:40,736 --> 00:01:42,336
call her family member.

5
00:01:42,415 --> 00:01:44,255
Tell him to bring their child here
to see her one last time.

6
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,484
Okay.

7
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,024
Professor Ren!

8
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:50,536
Holding onto me won't help you.

9
00:01:54,936 --> 00:01:55,753
Master,

10
00:01:56,256 --> 00:01:58,055
I just saw a dead person
for the first time in my life.

11
00:02:37,936 --> 00:02:38,736
What are you looking at?

12
00:02:40,735 --> 00:02:41,855
You scared me.

13
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:42,855
You took the words out of my mouth!

14
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:49,296
I'm exhausted.

15
00:02:51,775 --> 00:02:52,735
Besides giving patients diagnoses,

16
00:02:53,455 --> 00:02:54,296
I have to stay on my toes
because of you.

17
00:02:55,535 --> 00:02:56,576
I'll bring the cops to you

18
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,616
when they're here.

19
00:03:04,056 --> 00:03:05,095
Cheng Ying isn't dead.

20
00:03:05,135 --> 00:03:06,656
Why did you lie to her?

21
00:03:08,616 --> 00:03:10,215
You did great today.

22
00:03:11,616 --> 00:03:12,735
When you first came in,

23
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:14,215
I thought you would run around,

24
00:03:14,215 --> 00:03:15,495
shouting that she wasn't dead.

25
00:03:20,495 --> 00:03:22,495
Am I that stupid to you?

26
00:03:25,696 --> 00:03:27,696
Although I don't know
why you're doing this,

27
00:03:27,696 --> 00:03:29,296
I know we're on the same side.

28
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,095
I have to play my part well.

29
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,449
Don't you think so?

30
00:03:40,376 --> 00:03:42,016
My master was right indeed.

31
00:03:43,216 --> 00:03:44,856
Even a dense person
can become intelligent.

32
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:47,760
That was respectable.

33
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,416
What do you mean by that?

34
00:04:00,815 --> 00:04:01,624
Get me a cup of water.

35

(Qibo Medical Centre)

36
00:04:47,815 --> 00:04:48,616
Professor Ren,

37
00:04:50,175 --> 00:04:52,856
if they do arrest me,

38
00:04:54,535 --> 00:04:56,696
can I entrust Jian Xi to you?

39
00:04:57,535 --> 00:04:58,976
In my life,

40
00:04:58,976 --> 00:05:00,336
there's no Ding Jian Xi.

41
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:02,856
She's your daughter.

42
00:05:07,696 --> 00:05:08,529
Okay.

43
00:05:09,535 --> 00:05:10,336
If so,

44
00:05:11,056 --> 00:05:12,616
I'll apologise to them.

45
00:05:13,455 --> 00:05:14,856
I'll kneel

46
00:05:14,976 --> 00:05:16,136
and kowtow to them.

47
00:05:16,976 --> 00:05:18,776
I'll give them all my money.

48
00:05:19,455 --> 00:05:20,896
I'm fine with anything
as long as they let me off

49
00:05:22,095 --> 00:05:23,735
and let me take care of Jian Xi.

50
00:05:25,095 --> 00:05:27,095
Why are you expecting them
to let you off?

51
00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:31,696
Cheng Ying bumped into
your daughter, right?

52
00:05:33,336 --> 00:05:34,616
She's dead, right?

53
00:05:36,056 --> 00:05:37,175
What else can I do?

54
00:05:37,735 --> 00:05:39,256
You're giving them all of your money?

55
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,856
How will you save your daughter by then?

56
00:05:43,535 --> 00:05:44,336
As long as

57
00:05:45,616 --> 00:05:46,616
she's alive,

58
00:05:47,256 --> 00:05:50,455
I'll find a way to save her
even if it means that I have to sell

59
00:05:51,336 --> 00:05:52,616
my house, even my kidneys.

60
00:06:01,056 --> 00:06:02,616
Don't do that. Please get up.

61
00:06:05,735 --> 00:06:06,656
Professor Ren,

62
00:06:08,175 --> 00:06:09,336
you're a benevolent person.

63
00:06:09,896 --> 00:06:11,056
You have a benevolent mind and heart.

64
00:06:12,336 --> 00:06:14,096
Can you take me and my daughter in?

65
00:06:14,816 --> 00:06:15,975
I can do anything.

66
00:06:17,175 --> 00:06:18,776
I was once an accountant.

67
00:06:19,175 --> 00:06:20,536
I can work as an admin.

68
00:06:21,175 --> 00:06:23,695
I can even be your janitor.

69
00:06:24,616 --> 00:06:26,455
I'll do anything you ask me to do

70
00:06:27,056 --> 00:06:28,455
as long as you take me
and my daughter in.

71
00:06:29,415 --> 00:06:31,896
You'll be imprisoned soon.

72
00:06:33,096 --> 00:06:34,975
How could you work here?

73
00:06:37,616 --> 00:06:39,496
Do you have any relatives?

74
00:06:39,496 --> 00:06:40,975
If you do, you should contact them.

75
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:43,816
How will I deal with your daughter

76
00:06:44,096 --> 00:06:45,975
after the cops arrest you?

77
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,896
Hurry and make your decision.

78
00:06:54,896 --> 00:06:56,376
What should I do?

79
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:16,816
I'll be imprisoned soon!

80
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:19,135
If I die now,

81
00:07:20,415 --> 00:07:23,695
I have no one to entrust my daughter to!

82
00:07:48,575 --> 00:07:49,936
Cheng Ying isn't dead.

83
00:07:54,096 --> 00:07:55,216
Get up.

84
00:07:55,295 --> 00:07:56,135
She's not dead?

85
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:57,096
She's not dead.

86
00:07:57,295 --> 00:07:58,415
I checked on her just now.

87
00:07:58,616 --> 00:07:59,575
She's alive.

88
00:07:59,695 --> 00:08:01,015
It's just that she's seriously ill.

89
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,020
She's not dead.

90
00:08:02,056 --> 00:08:03,096
Really?

91
00:08:03,135 --> 00:08:03,975
Really.

92
00:08:04,415 --> 00:08:05,295
I get to decide whether she dies or not

93
00:08:05,295 --> 00:08:06,896
when I'm around.

94
00:08:07,735 --> 00:08:08,575
Professor Ren,

95
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:10,936
I'm begging you.

96
00:08:11,295 --> 00:08:13,455
Please save her

97
00:08:13,575 --> 00:08:15,015
on the account of my daughter.

98
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,420
Alright.

99
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:17,536
Get up.

100
00:08:17,735 --> 00:08:18,855
Come.

101
00:08:18,855 --> 00:08:19,711
Be careful.

102
00:08:21,255 --> 00:08:22,056
Have some water.

103
00:08:27,816 --> 00:08:28,816
Be careful.

104
00:08:32,855 --> 00:08:33,735
Do you still hate her?

105
00:08:34,975 --> 00:08:37,536
You felt pure joy after
experiencing pure sadness.

106
00:08:37,855 --> 00:08:38,896
How do you feel?

107
00:08:47,336 --> 00:08:48,216
Let me ask you something.

108
00:08:49,575 --> 00:08:51,015
Did you ever think about

109
00:08:51,015 --> 00:08:52,415
joining your husband

110
00:08:52,415 --> 00:08:53,575
when he departed from the world?

111
00:08:56,015 --> 00:08:57,295
When one is dead,

112
00:08:58,015 --> 00:08:59,575
nothing will be left.

113
00:08:59,855 --> 00:09:01,575
Your source of hatred and grudge

114
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,295
will be gone.

115
00:09:03,295 --> 00:09:04,936
What if you departed together with him?

116
00:09:05,575 --> 00:09:06,855
What will Jian Xi do then?

117
00:09:10,295 --> 00:09:12,415
Alright. You've already gotten through

118
00:09:12,536 --> 00:09:14,735
the worst moment in your life.

119
00:09:15,336 --> 00:09:16,175
Anger

120
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,536
makes slaves of people.

121
00:09:20,015 --> 00:09:21,695
When you get angry,

122
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:25,015
you'll become your own slave.

123
00:09:27,855 --> 00:09:29,295
We forgive people

124
00:09:29,896 --> 00:09:30,975
to face

125
00:09:30,975 --> 00:09:32,855
our conscience.

126
00:09:34,536 --> 00:09:36,295
It's not like you've lost everything.

127
00:09:37,295 --> 00:09:38,455
You still have Jian Xi,

128
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,765
right?

129
00:09:45,575 --> 00:09:47,135
Have you found your tile?

130
00:09:49,575 --> 00:09:51,216
Look at you. You have been
spending all your energy

131
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,975
on trying to sue people, demanding money

132
00:09:53,975 --> 00:09:54,784
and cursing them out.

133
00:09:55,175 --> 00:09:56,455
What will Jian Xi do then?

134
00:10:00,536 --> 00:10:01,735
I'll look for it.

135
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,575
I must save Jian Xi.

136
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:06,455
That's why you should spend your energy

137
00:10:06,575 --> 00:10:08,896
on the things that matter.

138
00:10:10,656 --> 00:10:12,216
When you were angry,

139
00:10:12,336 --> 00:10:14,575
you forgot that
Jian Xi was by your side.

140
00:10:16,296 --> 00:10:18,176
What if Li Quan didn't save her?

141
00:10:18,255 --> 00:10:19,815
What if the wheelchair fell?

142
00:10:20,296 --> 00:10:22,096
Have you ever thought of
the consequences?

143
00:10:25,096 --> 00:10:27,815
Forgiving people means
forgiving yourself.

144
00:10:28,856 --> 00:10:30,296
You have to let go.

145
00:10:33,575 --> 00:10:34,416
You must be starving.

146
00:10:35,575 --> 00:10:36,935
Jian Xi hasn't eaten yet.

147
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,600
Yeah.

148
00:10:39,976 --> 00:10:41,615
Jian Xi hasn't eaten yet.

Mr Ren.

151

Something's up?

152
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,746
Yes.

153
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,055
I hope you can do me a favour.

154
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:43,736
Thank you for what you did today.

155
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:46,368
It was my job.

156
00:11:47,216 --> 00:11:48,055
What is it? Tell me.

157
00:11:50,856 --> 00:11:51,736
My parents want

158
00:11:51,736 --> 00:11:54,296
to celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival
here with me.

159
00:11:55,176 --> 00:11:57,176
Before this, I told them that...

160
00:11:59,296 --> 00:12:00,976
Stop hesitating.

161
00:12:00,976 --> 00:12:01,856
Speak up.

162
00:12:02,736 --> 00:12:03,736
Before this, I told them

163
00:12:03,736 --> 00:12:04,976
that I already found a job.

164
00:12:06,495 --> 00:12:07,416
So,

165
00:12:07,856 --> 00:12:09,536
can you tell them that I'm working here

166
00:12:09,856 --> 00:12:11,216
if you see them?

167
00:12:12,736 --> 00:12:13,695
Can you tell them I'm a staff here?

168
00:12:14,455 --> 00:12:16,216
Why would our medical centre
even hire staff in the first place?

169
00:12:17,776 --> 00:12:18,935
I know that's not the case.

170
00:12:21,495 --> 00:12:23,096
But can you tell them that?

171
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:26,976
You want me to lie to them?

172
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,935
Listen.

173
00:12:30,096 --> 00:12:31,416
I never lie.

174
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,615
And, I will never lie for your sake.

175
00:12:35,176 --> 00:12:36,856
Once you lie, you need to lie ten times

176
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,536
to cover up your first lie.

177
00:12:38,736 --> 00:12:40,296
If you wish to obtain something,

178
00:12:40,615 --> 00:12:42,216
you must strive to obtain it.

179
00:12:42,216 --> 00:12:43,336
Do not rely on expediency.

180
00:12:44,176 --> 00:12:44,985
Understood?

181
00:13:19,615 --> 00:13:21,336
Sorry for being late.

182
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:22,896
I couldn't recognise you in this outfit.

183
00:13:23,495 --> 00:13:25,216
What kind of outfit is this?

184
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,856
I don't like the smell of kitchen fumes.

185
00:13:28,536 --> 00:13:29,896
Sorry then, Ms Yang.

186
00:13:30,736 --> 00:13:31,776
You haven't ordered any food yet, right?

187
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,660
Listen,

188
00:13:32,696 --> 00:13:33,976
the roasted kidneys here

189
00:13:34,096 --> 00:13:34,976
are amazing.

190
00:13:37,736 --> 00:13:38,976
I... I forgot.

191
00:13:38,976 --> 00:13:40,055
You're a vegetarian.

192
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,096
Their roasted chives and mushrooms

193
00:13:42,096 --> 00:13:43,495
are great too.

194
00:13:43,495 --> 00:13:44,736
Don't order food for me.

195
00:13:45,495 --> 00:13:46,536
I waited until now

196
00:13:46,536 --> 00:13:48,255
to reject you directly.

197
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:49,856
The tuition class between us

198
00:13:49,856 --> 00:13:50,776
is over.

199
00:13:50,776 --> 00:13:51,896
Okay? Let's go on our separate ways.

200
00:13:53,856 --> 00:13:54,736
What are you doing?

201
00:13:54,976 --> 00:13:56,055
Return my bag to me.

202
00:13:56,055 --> 00:13:57,375
You can keep this bag

203
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,176
with me first.

204
00:13:58,176 --> 00:14:00,375
I'll return it to you once
the tuition class is over.

205
00:14:00,776 --> 00:14:01,976
-You!
-Madam!

206
00:14:03,096 --> 00:14:05,416
Give us ten roasted lamb skewers,

207
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:06,776
ten roasted kidney skewers,

208
00:14:06,776 --> 00:14:08,976
one roasted mushroom skewer
and one roasted chives skewer.

209
00:14:09,736 --> 00:14:10,896
-Just like the usual.
-Alright.

210
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:11,976
Didn't I tell you already?

211
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,296
I'm not eating.
Don't order anything for me.

212
00:14:13,296 --> 00:14:14,615
I don't take junk food.

213
00:14:14,856 --> 00:14:15,856
I ordered them for myself.

214
00:14:37,536 --> 00:14:38,376
Delicious.

215
00:14:40,536 --> 00:14:41,615
It's a shame that
you're not trying them.

216
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,856
Let me tell you this.

217
00:14:44,856 --> 00:14:46,856
I came here today

218
00:14:46,856 --> 00:14:49,055
because I thought it was closer
to your hospital.

219
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,495
But it won't happen again.

220
00:14:51,096 --> 00:14:51,889
Yeah, yeah.

221
00:14:52,176 --> 00:14:53,776
But according to
my limited life experience,

222
00:14:53,776 --> 00:14:54,856
only bars and roasted skewer stalls

223
00:14:54,856 --> 00:14:56,495
are still open at this hour.

224
00:14:56,536 --> 00:14:57,976
Bars are too loud.

225
00:14:57,976 --> 00:14:59,135
I don't think we can hold
our tuition class there.

226
00:14:59,495 --> 00:15:01,296
Can't you change it
to another time then?

227
00:15:01,856 --> 00:15:03,176
I'm having tuition classes
during my night shifts

228
00:15:03,176 --> 00:15:05,176
so that I can head to the medical centre
during my rest days.

229
00:15:10,736 --> 00:15:11,545
Alright.

230
00:15:12,216 --> 00:15:13,053
Let's begin.

231
00:15:14,296 --> 00:15:15,536
You're taking

232
00:15:15,536 --> 00:15:18,055
something this oily and salty at night.

233
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:20,216
Your lifestyle is so unhealthy.

234
00:15:21,096 --> 00:15:22,856
Just finish your yogurt
and be done with your preaching.

235
00:15:23,536 --> 00:15:25,216
You're a doctor, you know?

236
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:27,815
I study Western medicine.

237
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:31,336
However, I'm giving you tuition
regarding TCM.

238
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:33,536
TCM focuses on wellness.

239
00:15:33,536 --> 00:15:35,575
Focusing on one's wellness should be
prioritized above treating illnesses.

240
00:15:35,575 --> 00:15:36,615
So, according to your TCM theories,

241
00:15:36,615 --> 00:15:38,375
at this time, you should
leave your phone in the living room

242
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,656
and lie on the bed, right?

243
00:15:40,935 --> 00:15:42,656
You're staying up to teach me about TCM.

244
00:15:42,736 --> 00:15:44,856
I can only repay you

245
00:15:44,856 --> 00:15:45,776
with such a method.

246
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,416
For this chapter,

247
00:16:01,776 --> 00:16:03,615
we focus on

248
00:16:03,615 --> 00:16:05,375
the relationship between
one's nature, heart, and body.

249
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,495
According to Mr Ren,

250
00:16:06,856 --> 00:16:09,615
even if we do retain our fitness,

251
00:16:09,976 --> 00:16:13,495
we're only 10% there.

252
00:16:13,495 --> 00:16:15,375
The other 40% comes from

253
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,656
the health of one's mentality.

254
00:16:18,216 --> 00:16:21,815
And, the one leading our health
is the health of our nature.

255
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,817
Look.

256
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:24,776
I'm right, aren't I?

257
00:16:25,176 --> 00:16:27,055
TCM and Western medicine
are finally coming together.

258
00:16:27,296 --> 00:16:28,615
One's diet isn't important at all.

259
00:16:28,776 --> 00:16:31,455
If I do die early, it must be
due to a lack of sexual activities.

260
00:16:32,736 --> 00:16:34,135
That wasn't what I was referring to.

261
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:35,856
It means disposition

262
00:16:35,856 --> 00:16:37,096
and spirituality.

263
00:16:37,615 --> 00:16:40,856
It's an element
that's above one's heart.

264
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,695
It's the inner core of life.

265
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:44,296
According to
Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic,

266
00:16:44,736 --> 00:16:46,176
somatic and spiritual harmony
are of utmost importance.

267
00:16:46,495 --> 00:16:47,856
A healthy body

268
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,375
requires a fit physical body

269
00:16:50,536 --> 00:16:53,416
and a healthy state of mind.

270
00:16:53,856 --> 00:16:55,055
We should be tranquil

271
00:16:55,776 --> 00:16:56,815
and have a sound mind.

272
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:00,416
That's what I meant by nature.

273
00:17:00,976 --> 00:17:02,176
Our teacher said this during our class.

274
00:17:02,776 --> 00:17:05,896
Language represents
the evolution of thoughts.

275
00:17:06,176 --> 00:17:07,896
What were you thinking about?

276
00:17:08,216 --> 00:17:09,736
I'm just here to give you a tuition.

277
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:12,494
Fine. Seems like you're done
with studying anyway.

278
00:17:12,935 --> 00:17:14,375
-It's over.
-You're angry now?

279
00:17:15,255 --> 00:17:16,216
You're a lawyer, right?

280
00:17:16,575 --> 00:17:17,695
You're studying TCM too.

281
00:17:17,935 --> 00:17:21,015
Being emotional is detrimental to us.

282
00:17:21,216 --> 00:17:23,216
You cannot be emotional
when you're in the court.

283
00:17:23,374 --> 00:17:24,975
When it comes to studying TCM,

284
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:27,896
we need to be indifferent
when we're happy, angry, sad, or joyful.

285
00:17:27,896 --> 00:17:29,455
Only then, we can retain our hearts.

286
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:30,935
What do you think? I did do my homework.

287
00:17:31,856 --> 00:17:32,815
I'm not angry.

288
00:17:34,015 --> 00:17:35,656
I just want to head back
and take my beauty sleep.

289
00:17:36,935 --> 00:17:37,815
Alright.

290
00:17:38,055 --> 00:17:40,015
I apologise to you sincerely.

291
00:17:41,575 --> 00:17:43,815
You're both a great teacher
and a great student.

292
00:17:43,815 --> 00:17:45,216
It was tough for you to teach me.

293
00:17:45,255 --> 00:17:46,111
I'm sorry.

294
00:17:47,495 --> 00:17:48,656
I'm not a good student.

295
00:17:49,615 --> 00:17:52,296
If I were one, I wouldn't
need to study TCM.

296
00:17:53,695 --> 00:17:54,520
But why?

297
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,455
I learned many things in the past.

298
00:17:59,135 --> 00:18:00,416
I excelled in all of them.

299
00:18:00,896 --> 00:18:02,695
But even now, I still don't understand

300
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,096
the meaning of life.

301
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,856
In the past, I strove to improve myself

302
00:18:08,575 --> 00:18:10,135
to make my mother happy.

303
00:18:10,896 --> 00:18:12,015
I worked hard to make money

304
00:18:13,055 --> 00:18:14,455
so that I could sustain her life.

305
00:18:16,015 --> 00:18:17,375
But after her passing,

306
00:18:17,776 --> 00:18:19,096
I suddenly realised

307
00:18:21,296 --> 00:18:23,135
that making money and improving myself

308
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:24,736
were pointless.

309
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:28,673
Do you know something?

310
00:18:29,096 --> 00:18:29,935
Some time ago,

311
00:18:29,935 --> 00:18:31,096
the opposing lawyer of a lawsuit

312
00:18:31,096 --> 00:18:32,736
fell unconscious in front of me.

313
00:18:32,976 --> 00:18:34,135
He died just like that.

314
00:18:34,976 --> 00:18:37,015
After that, I thought about
all the law articles I learned.

315
00:18:37,296 --> 00:18:38,495
Why did I learn them in the first place?

316
00:18:41,516 --> 00:18:42,656
Mr Ren was right.

317
00:18:43,936 --> 00:18:46,615
Even if you're knowledgeable,
that doesn't mean you're cultured.

318
00:18:46,615 --> 00:18:47,576
We transform people through culture.

319
00:18:48,536 --> 00:18:49,656
Forget about transforming other people.

320
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:53,576
I can't even transform myself.

321
00:18:55,975 --> 00:18:56,936
You're transforming me right now.

322
00:18:58,176 --> 00:18:59,416
I'm not that capable.

323
00:18:59,696 --> 00:19:00,656
You're a stubborn soul.

324
00:19:00,656 --> 00:19:02,615
You're taking junk food
in the middle of the night.

325
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,176
I have a good nature.

326
00:19:05,296 --> 00:19:06,176
I'm broad-minded.

327
00:19:06,176 --> 00:19:07,615
I don't take things too seriously.

328
00:19:07,615 --> 00:19:09,375
That's the root of good health.

329
00:19:13,215 --> 00:19:14,456
Broad-minded, huh?

330
00:19:14,735 --> 00:19:16,855
Explain why you came
to cause trouble for our class

331
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,536
and got into a fight
with a patient's family member.

332
00:19:21,095 --> 00:19:22,255
Why do you know all of my secrets?

333
00:19:22,656 --> 00:19:24,375
How did you know that I was a spy?

334
00:19:24,936 --> 00:19:26,375
It wasn't a secret at all.

335
00:19:27,095 --> 00:19:29,495
Mr Ren knew it from
the day you joined us.

336
00:19:30,176 --> 00:19:31,255
You were scrolling your phone
during class.

337
00:19:31,776 --> 00:19:32,776
And, you kept causing arguments.

338
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:34,416
I'll be honest with you.

339
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,375
I only came here to give you tuition

340
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,855
because of Mr Ren.

341
00:19:36,855 --> 00:19:38,176
If not, do you think

342
00:19:38,296 --> 00:19:40,495
I'll waste my time with you here?

343
00:19:40,735 --> 00:19:41,936
Mr Ren knew about it?

344
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:42,975
Of course.

345
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,536
If so, why did he still send you here?

346
00:19:45,495 --> 00:19:46,696
Mr Ren

347
00:19:47,095 --> 00:19:49,255
has placed himself and his lesson

348
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:51,855
on a microscope for you to see.

349
00:19:53,015 --> 00:19:55,255
Western medicine focuses on
the patient's illness

350
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,255
while TCM focuses on the sick person.

351
00:19:58,255 --> 00:19:59,416
You can cause an argument

352
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:00,375
and create trouble all you want.

353
00:20:01,095 --> 00:20:02,135
But Mr Ren intends

354
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:04,495
to cure you of your rowdy nature.

355
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,168
Madam,

356
00:20:17,656 --> 00:20:18,576
get me another bottle of yogurt.

357
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,855
-Okay.
-Get me a sugar-free yogurt.

358
00:20:21,656 --> 00:20:22,528
Coming.

359
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,576
What are you doing here?
Did you tail me?

360
00:21:59,896 --> 00:22:00,808
You...

361
00:22:00,855 --> 00:22:02,495
You know how to ride skateboards?

362
00:22:03,015 --> 00:22:04,375
I know plenty of things.

363
00:22:04,776 --> 00:22:05,609
Ren Tian Zhen.

364
00:22:08,855 --> 00:22:09,656
This is pretty cool.

365
00:22:10,536 --> 00:22:11,975
I want to learn this too.

366
00:22:15,135 --> 00:22:16,095
You want to learn
how to ride skateboards?

367
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:16,950
Yeah.

368
00:22:16,975 --> 00:22:18,215
-Really?
-Yeah.

369
00:22:18,536 --> 00:22:19,495
But I don't feel like teaching you.

370
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,536
If you don't teach me,

371
00:22:26,015 --> 00:22:27,375
I'll tell your parents

372
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:29,215
and grandparents

373
00:22:29,536 --> 00:22:31,776
that you're playing with something
as dangerous as this.

374
00:22:31,855 --> 00:22:32,656
It's very dangerous.

375
00:22:32,735 --> 00:22:34,135
It's lethal and dangerous.

376
00:22:34,135 --> 00:22:35,255
I'll tell them right away.

377
00:22:35,536 --> 00:22:36,536
Are you a primary school student?

378
00:22:36,536 --> 00:22:37,536
You want to complain
to your teacher now?

379
00:22:41,656 --> 00:22:43,375
Go ahead then. You'll be exposed
for joining me too.

380
00:22:44,095 --> 00:22:44,936
That's fine.

381
00:22:45,015 --> 00:22:46,776
I'm parentless anyway.

382
00:22:46,776 --> 00:22:48,056
No one is keeping me in check.

383
00:22:48,135 --> 00:22:49,615
But it's different for someone else.

384
00:22:50,015 --> 00:22:52,335
You're their beloved baby.

385
00:22:52,656 --> 00:22:54,095
Your grandparents will surely nag you

386
00:22:54,095 --> 00:22:55,255
after they find out.

387
00:22:55,255 --> 00:22:57,015
You have to stand there
and endure their nagging

388
00:22:57,015 --> 00:22:58,456
without talking back.

389
00:22:58,536 --> 00:22:59,735
If Meng Meng sees that,

390
00:22:59,776 --> 00:23:01,176
-Stop!
-as a man...

391
00:23:01,176 --> 00:23:02,069
Stop.

392
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:03,080
I'll teach you.

393
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:05,335
But you have to swear.

394
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:07,536
Only you and I know about this.

395
00:23:07,896 --> 00:23:09,735
Never tell a single soul about this.

396
00:23:09,735 --> 00:23:12,015
I swear I'll never tell a single soul.

397
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,456
If you break your promise,

398
00:23:13,615 --> 00:23:15,735
may you starve for
the rest of your life.

399
00:23:19,975 --> 00:23:20,815
That's pretty brutal.

400
00:23:21,656 --> 00:23:23,375
I promise. When will you teach me?

401
00:23:24,816 --> 00:23:26,255
Meng Meng's medicine is ready, right?

402
00:23:26,495 --> 00:23:27,359
What medicine?

403
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:31,656
Oh no!

404
00:23:33,296 --> 00:23:34,416
Remember to teach me next time!

405
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,616
Thank you.

406
00:23:40,975 --> 00:23:41,831
Don't mention it.

407
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,121
Hello, Madam.

408
00:23:44,255 --> 00:23:45,375
-Hello.
-Madam,

409
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,318
I'm here to pick up my parcel.

410
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:47,735
I'm Xiao Ming from Dorm 312.

411
00:23:47,735 --> 00:23:48,776
312, Xiao Ming.

412
00:23:50,735 --> 00:23:52,015
312, Xiao Ming.

413
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:52,808
Here.

414
00:23:54,536 --> 00:23:55,816
-Thank you, Madam.
-You're welcome.

415
00:23:58,015 --> 00:23:58,879
Hello, Madam.

416
00:23:58,975 --> 00:23:59,768
Hello.

417
00:24:15,536 --> 00:24:16,456
What's the matter?

418
00:24:17,135 --> 00:24:17,975
I guess

419
00:24:18,296 --> 00:24:19,176
we have another power outage.

420
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,140
What's going on?

421
00:24:20,163 --> 00:24:21,056
What's going on?

422
00:24:21,056 --> 00:24:22,296
The power tripped again?

423
00:24:23,975 --> 00:24:25,215
We have another power outage?

424
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:26,375
Sorry about that.

425
00:24:27,095 --> 00:24:28,056
Open the door!

426
00:24:28,056 --> 00:24:29,335
Hide! Hurry up!

427
00:24:29,656 --> 00:24:30,776
Why did the power trip again?

428
00:24:31,015 --> 00:24:31,896
Coming.

429
00:24:34,536 --> 00:24:35,408
Coming.

430
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:39,015
You must've used something
that you were not supposed to.

431
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:43,855
I knew it.

432
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,375
Didn't I say that you couldn't
bring this here?

433
00:24:47,896 --> 00:24:49,015
You were actually
cooking dumplings here?

434
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:50,816
Sorry, Madam. I was starving.

435
00:24:51,095 --> 00:24:52,015
I won't do it again.

436
00:24:52,615 --> 00:24:53,896
I'll never do it again.

437
00:24:53,896 --> 00:24:55,576
-Okay?
-How many times have I told you?

438
00:24:55,936 --> 00:24:56,761
Yes, Madam.

439
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:05,136
Who are you?

440
00:25:05,735 --> 00:25:06,656
What are you doing here?

441
00:25:11,215 --> 00:25:12,040
Madam.

442
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:16,970
(Qibo Medical Centre)

443
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,975
You were chased out?

444
00:25:18,255 --> 00:25:19,296
Where are you staying then?

445
00:25:19,416 --> 00:25:21,215
I found a cheap place online.

446
00:25:21,776 --> 00:25:23,735
One day costs around 30 to 40 yuan.

447
00:25:23,735 --> 00:25:24,615
Can you take a bath there?

448
00:25:25,656 --> 00:25:26,975
Take a bath?

449
00:25:26,975 --> 00:25:28,375
I'm lucky enough
to find a place to stay.

450
00:25:30,536 --> 00:25:32,215
It's easy for you to make remarks
when you're on the sideline.

451
00:25:36,296 --> 00:25:37,176
I'll find a place for you.

452
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:42,900
See?

453
00:25:43,015 --> 00:25:45,135
When you want to sleep, just bring
this bed to the storeroom.

454
00:25:46,896 --> 00:25:47,729
This is inappropriate.

455
00:25:48,015 --> 00:25:49,576
What's inappropriate about it?

456
00:25:49,896 --> 00:25:50,896
I'll be here for you
if you get into trouble.

457
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:53,615
Besides, you're truly stubborn.

458
00:25:53,855 --> 00:25:56,375
If I were you, I would try to be
a medical assistant here

459
00:25:56,536 --> 00:25:58,215
and survive first.

460
00:25:58,296 --> 00:25:59,495
You and I are different.

461
00:26:02,015 --> 00:26:04,416
Say, if I do work in this medical centre

462
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,855
like my other seniors,

463
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,776
even if I do get my own
consultation office after ten years,

464
00:26:09,296 --> 00:26:10,576
do you think people will
seek my service after that?

465
00:26:11,615 --> 00:26:12,776
In this industry,

466
00:26:12,776 --> 00:26:14,656
value comes with age.

467
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:16,495
You're different.

468
00:26:16,495 --> 00:26:18,135
You had a silver-spoon upbringing.

469
00:26:18,776 --> 00:26:20,416
You grew up in an esteemed family.

470
00:26:20,416 --> 00:26:21,456
No matter which mentor you get,

471
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:22,855
they're the cream of the crop.

472
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,860
But me?

473
00:26:23,896 --> 00:26:25,135
I can only say this for myself.

474
00:26:26,135 --> 00:26:27,975
If one of the mentors
takes a liking to me,

475
00:26:28,095 --> 00:26:29,656
and if I learn under him,

476
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:31,896
maybe I can be independent
after five years.

477
00:26:32,255 --> 00:26:33,095
Tell me then.

478
00:26:34,416 --> 00:26:36,296
What will I do

479
00:26:36,536 --> 00:26:37,615
if I don't depend on the medical centre?

480
00:26:38,776 --> 00:26:41,095
Free opportunities for people
to learn under a mentor

481
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:43,255
were created for people like me,
you know?

482
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:50,975
These are the keys
to the medical centre.

483
00:26:51,135 --> 00:26:52,056
Just remember

484
00:26:52,296 --> 00:26:53,776
to bring the bed back and hide it here

485
00:26:53,776 --> 00:26:55,816
before work hours.

486
00:26:57,135 --> 00:26:57,968
Got it.

487
00:27:00,176 --> 00:27:01,335
You don't intend to thank me?

488
00:27:02,296 --> 00:27:03,375
Thank you so much.

489
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:04,215
You're too courteous.

490
00:27:08,855 --> 00:27:10,135
Why did you transfer money to me again?

491
00:27:11,015 --> 00:27:12,855
I made some pocket money
when I joined Grandpa

492
00:27:12,855 --> 00:27:13,855
in his consultations.

493
00:27:13,855 --> 00:27:15,495
Of course I need to share
good things with my buddy.

494
00:27:16,095 --> 00:27:17,776
Your grandfather actually
split the money with you?

495
00:27:17,776 --> 00:27:19,375
Nope. It's all mine.

496
00:27:19,656 --> 00:27:20,855
We had a promise.

497
00:27:21,095 --> 00:27:22,296
He'll work for me as long as

498
00:27:22,296 --> 00:27:23,176
I'm willing to join him
in his consultations.

499
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:25,896
If so, I won't stand on ceremony then.

500
00:27:26,176 --> 00:27:27,375
There's no need to stand on ceremony.

501
00:27:33,536 --> 00:27:34,384
Mr Ren.

502
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:39,416
What are you two doing here?

503
00:27:42,135 --> 00:27:43,015
We're here on cleaning duties.

504
00:27:49,896 --> 00:27:52,375
So, you don't need tools for that?

505
00:27:55,656 --> 00:27:56,696
We'll get them at once.

506
00:27:59,015 --> 00:28:00,296
-Mr Wu.
-Mr Wu.

507
00:28:00,495 --> 00:28:01,348
Kid.

508
00:28:02,495 --> 00:28:03,304
How did it go?

509
00:28:03,495 --> 00:28:04,375
You must've received
the invitation by now.

510
00:28:04,855 --> 00:28:05,896
I received it yesterday.

511
00:28:06,656 --> 00:28:09,375
Fellow Zhang will be
the honorary chairman this year.

512
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:12,135
You will be our main speaker.

513
00:28:12,776 --> 00:28:14,335
I still want Huang Wei
to be our speaker.

514
00:28:14,416 --> 00:28:15,696
You should give
the younger generations a chance.

515
00:28:17,615 --> 00:28:20,015
Which student do you intend
to bring with you?

516
00:28:20,296 --> 00:28:22,696
Tian Zhen, Li Quan,

517
00:28:23,056 --> 00:28:24,015
and Sun Tou Tou.

518
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,536
Sun Tou Tou?

519
00:28:27,015 --> 00:28:27,896
Do you think someone will take her in?

520
00:28:28,015 --> 00:28:29,615
Were you referring to Sun Tou Tou?

521
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:31,580
Sun Tou Tou

522
00:28:31,602 --> 00:28:34,580
is the successor of the Jiang family's
acupuncture sect after all.

523
00:28:35,615 --> 00:28:37,375
She already assumed her position.

524
00:28:38,255 --> 00:28:40,375
She has to go there no matter what.

525
00:28:41,776 --> 00:28:45,296
I'm just worried that she might
bring disgrace to TCM Acupuncture.

526
00:28:45,656 --> 00:28:47,936
This is TCM Acupuncture's
first appearance.

527
00:28:48,656 --> 00:28:50,495
Just look at her primitive behaviour.

528
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,615
What do you think people
will say about you

529
00:28:52,615 --> 00:28:54,375
and TCM Acupuncture?

530
00:28:55,135 --> 00:28:57,135
That's their business.

531
00:28:57,656 --> 00:28:59,776
It's her business whether she can become

532
00:28:59,936 --> 00:29:00,776
a worthy successor or not.

533
00:29:01,176 --> 00:29:02,375
It's my business

534
00:29:02,576 --> 00:29:03,696
whether I bring her there or not.

535
00:29:04,095 --> 00:29:06,135
We all have our parts to do.

536
00:29:07,855 --> 00:29:09,135
You're making it too simple here.

537
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:11,855
You can afford to take it lightly
since you don't have any position.

538
00:29:12,776 --> 00:29:14,495
Now, I'm attending the forum

539
00:29:14,495 --> 00:29:15,735
as the academy's principal.

540
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:17,064
But you?

541
00:29:17,495 --> 00:29:18,735
You're trying to link my academy

542
00:29:19,015 --> 00:29:20,696
with your so-called students,

543
00:29:20,696 --> 00:29:21,656
which have complicated backgrounds.

544
00:29:21,656 --> 00:29:23,896
What do you think people will say
about our industry as a whole?

545
00:29:24,536 --> 00:29:25,776
Besides, you shouldn't forget.

546
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:28,975
I'm holding on to this position
for your sake.

547
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:31,576
You have to consider my feelings.

548
00:29:32,656 --> 00:29:34,335
That's your business.

549
00:29:34,536 --> 00:29:35,408
But...

550
00:29:36,015 --> 00:29:38,135
I'm sure it's everyone's business
to maintain our reputation, right?

551
00:29:39,495 --> 00:29:40,375
Reputation, huh?

552
00:29:46,495 --> 00:29:47,335
Meng Meng,

553
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:48,536
sesame seeds

554
00:29:48,656 --> 00:29:50,776
are good for injuries and deficiencies.
It also nourishes the five viscera.

555
00:29:56,135 --> 00:29:56,975
Try it.

556
00:30:00,255 --> 00:30:01,080
It's nice, right?

557
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,215
This is for Wu Jun.

558
00:30:07,416 --> 00:30:08,816
He has to get twice the dosage.

559
00:30:11,296 --> 00:30:12,656
Ms Xia?

560
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:15,713
So,

561
00:30:16,095 --> 00:30:18,015
Jian Xi's follow-up visit

562
00:30:18,015 --> 00:30:18,896
is in two days, right?

563
00:30:18,896 --> 00:30:20,576
What are you guys doing here today?

564
00:30:20,975 --> 00:30:22,375
Not only will we come today,

565
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:24,176
but we'll also come here every day.

566
00:30:25,495 --> 00:30:26,615
What do you mean?

567
00:30:26,615 --> 00:30:28,095
Ms Xia, listen.

568
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:30,936
Sometimes, you need to let go.

569
00:30:30,936 --> 00:30:32,375
Calm down.

570
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:33,776
I'm not here to stir up trouble.

571
00:30:34,095 --> 00:30:35,296
I'm here to help.

572
00:30:35,896 --> 00:30:37,576
I told Professor Ren

573
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:39,056
that I worked as an accountant before.

574
00:30:39,135 --> 00:30:40,176
From today onward,

575
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,536
I will work as a volunteer here.

576
00:30:42,855 --> 00:30:44,015
Today's my first day of work.

577
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,500
Really?

578
00:30:46,536 --> 00:30:47,776
I never heard about that.

579
00:30:47,776 --> 00:30:49,855
Weren't you here too back then?

580
00:30:50,855 --> 00:30:52,615
If so, have you stopped
looking for the tiles?

581
00:30:52,776 --> 00:30:53,615
Of course not.

582
00:30:53,735 --> 00:30:55,135
I've already hired someone
to inquire about them for me.

583
00:30:55,296 --> 00:30:56,816
I'll depart immediately
once I receive any news.

584
00:30:57,135 --> 00:30:58,776
By then, I will leave Jian Xi...

585
00:30:59,176 --> 00:31:00,656
-No problem.
-Meng Meng.

586
00:31:02,776 --> 00:31:03,640
Meng Meng.

587
00:31:04,776 --> 00:31:05,576
Meng Meng.

588
00:31:06,776 --> 00:31:07,975
It'll be fine. Go now.

589
00:31:08,656 --> 00:31:09,504
Come here.

590
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,500
Meng Meng.

591
00:31:10,656 --> 00:31:11,896
Meng Meng, come here.

592
00:31:12,135 --> 00:31:13,855
I'm not here to fight today.

593
00:31:14,615 --> 00:31:16,776
I must've scared you guys back then.

594
00:31:16,776 --> 00:31:17,615
Not at all.

595
00:31:17,735 --> 00:31:18,568
Not at all.

596
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,660
Go now. It'll be fine.

597
00:31:20,682 --> 00:31:22,215
I'm not here to fight.

598
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:26,015
Everything's fine.

599
00:31:26,776 --> 00:31:27,776
Don't be scared.

600
00:31:27,776 --> 00:31:28,776
Zhu Xia, you're here?

601
00:31:28,776 --> 00:31:29,576
Dr Song.

602
00:31:29,576 --> 00:31:30,896
Who's afraid?

603
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:32,983
Listen.

604
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:34,015
That's right.

605
00:31:34,135 --> 00:31:37,375
This ledger contains
this month's records.

606
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:38,047
Take it.

607
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,047
Take a close look.

608
00:31:39,095 --> 00:31:40,456
Yes. Meng Meng loves to draw.

609
00:31:40,456 --> 00:31:41,312
Familiarize yourself with our accounts.

610
00:31:42,095 --> 00:31:43,656
I'll leave this to you then.

611
00:31:44,416 --> 00:31:46,215
Now that I'm here,
you don't need to worry.

612
00:31:49,416 --> 00:31:50,296
Jian Xi.

613
00:31:52,615 --> 00:31:53,495
Dr Song.

614
00:31:55,776 --> 00:31:56,656
Say,

615
00:31:56,896 --> 00:31:58,855
she did change a lot.

616
00:31:59,896 --> 00:32:00,832
This is amazing.

617
00:32:04,176 --> 00:32:05,215
Your master is amazing, right?

618
00:32:10,735 --> 00:32:11,776
He's pretty amazing.

619
00:32:13,896 --> 00:32:15,615
Meng Meng, that looked great.

620
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,637
(Plantable grains)

621
00:32:21,926 --> 00:32:24,339
(lose their effectiveness
after this season.)

622
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,525
(This solar term)

623
00:32:27,218 --> 00:32:30,825
(is the time when the South plants
grains and the North harvests wheat.)

624
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,479
(Grain in Ear)

625
00:32:45,576 --> 00:32:49,536
TCM is the manifestation of the term
"technique and integrity".

626
00:32:49,896 --> 00:32:53,056
However, without integrity, you can't
make it far with technique alone.

627
00:32:53,296 --> 00:32:54,896
Even if you have excellent
medical skills,

628
00:32:55,255 --> 00:32:56,735
without harmony between nature and men

629
00:32:58,015 --> 00:32:59,176
and a broad philosophical view,

630
00:32:59,176 --> 00:33:01,135
you won't be able to understand

631
00:33:02,135 --> 00:33:04,855
the meaning of "integrity"
when it comes to medical skills.

632
00:33:05,975 --> 00:33:09,255
That's the difference between
TCM and Western medicine.

633
00:33:09,255 --> 00:33:10,456
In my opinion,

634
00:33:11,536 --> 00:33:14,255
Western medicine will
develop into a detailed

635
00:33:15,015 --> 00:33:16,296
and meticulous field.

636
00:33:16,896 --> 00:33:18,015
As for TCM,

637
00:33:19,095 --> 00:33:22,656
it should develop in
a broader direction.

638
00:33:23,656 --> 00:33:25,296
For our lesson today,

639
00:33:25,776 --> 00:33:26,735
we'll talk about

640
00:33:28,495 --> 00:33:31,135
the largest disharmony in humans.

641
00:33:34,656 --> 00:33:35,489
What is it?

642
00:33:38,656 --> 00:33:40,095
It's disharmony between humans.

643
00:33:42,735 --> 00:33:43,591
Everyone,

644
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:46,375
do you know who's the star of

645
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:47,696
our TCM industrial park?

646
00:33:47,696 --> 00:33:48,521
Who?

647
00:33:49,015 --> 00:33:50,015
It's Ren Xin Zheng.

648
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:52,255
Professor Ren?

649
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:54,176
He's pretty famous.

650
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,536
What? Is he here?

651
00:33:55,975 --> 00:33:57,776
We are friends for many years.

652
00:33:57,776 --> 00:33:59,855
Now, he's hosting a class
at my place.

653
00:34:00,656 --> 00:34:03,095
He's the representative figure
of our industrial park.

654
00:34:03,536 --> 00:34:04,576
He's hosting a class?

655
00:34:06,095 --> 00:34:07,855
We plan to build

656
00:34:07,855 --> 00:34:09,135
a first-class national

657
00:34:09,655 --> 00:34:11,295
TCM talent training centre.

658
00:34:13,255 --> 00:34:15,095
Right now, the projects that
occupy most of your land here

659
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:16,536
aren't in the direction
we're investing in.

660
00:34:16,776 --> 00:34:18,615
They lack Internet thinking.

661
00:34:18,615 --> 00:34:19,416
Besides,

662
00:34:19,615 --> 00:34:20,416
building a school

663
00:34:20,416 --> 00:34:22,215
was a great way to develop
one's land in the last century.

664
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:23,535
But to put it bluntly,

665
00:34:23,974 --> 00:34:25,494
it'll take a long time

666
00:34:25,494 --> 00:34:26,655
before we can gain profit from it.

667
00:34:29,615 --> 00:34:31,375
Great minds think alike indeed.

668
00:34:32,014 --> 00:34:34,014
We're implementing Internet thinking.

669
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:35,655
The class is free.

670
00:34:35,896 --> 00:34:36,896
We attract talents first.

671
00:34:36,896 --> 00:34:38,335
We've invited many renowned figures

672
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:40,056
to teach here.

673
00:34:40,135 --> 00:34:41,576
Once news of this gets out,

674
00:34:42,014 --> 00:34:42,854
those who wish

675
00:34:42,855 --> 00:34:44,656
to join the TCM industry

676
00:34:44,896 --> 00:34:46,494
have to join us

677
00:34:46,494 --> 00:34:48,734
before they can establish
a foothold in the industry.

678
00:34:49,135 --> 00:34:50,855
We can brag about this shamelessly.

679
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,220
This is

680
00:34:52,255 --> 00:34:54,296
a business academy for TCM.

681
00:34:57,896 --> 00:34:59,095
Other business academies

682
00:34:59,095 --> 00:35:00,495
earn hundreds of thousands easily.

683
00:35:00,495 --> 00:35:01,896
But your academy is offering
classes for free.

684
00:35:02,135 --> 00:35:03,135
How could you compare yourself to them?

685
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:05,696
When we're emotional,

686
00:35:06,656 --> 00:35:07,656
when we have hatred in our hearts,

687
00:35:08,015 --> 00:35:09,735
when we're frustrated,
what do you think we should do?

688
00:35:10,896 --> 00:35:11,752
Do you think you'll be fine

689
00:35:12,776 --> 00:35:14,375
after getting surgery
and taking medicine?

690
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:16,975
Obviously, that won't work.

691
00:35:18,255 --> 00:35:19,375
What should we do then?

692
00:35:20,855 --> 00:35:23,135
According to the Doctrine of the Mean,

693
00:35:23,816 --> 00:35:26,296
when joy, anger, sorrow,
and pleasure have not yet arisen,

694
00:35:26,536 --> 00:35:27,576
it is called "moderate".

695
00:35:30,536 --> 00:35:31,495
But guys,

696
00:35:32,015 --> 00:35:33,936
we, humans, aren't

697
00:35:33,975 --> 00:35:35,375
deities in temples.

698
00:35:35,656 --> 00:35:37,776
When we have anger,

699
00:35:37,776 --> 00:35:39,176
we must vent it out.

700
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:41,416
Here comes the latter part
of the saying.

701
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:46,815
When they arise to their appropriate
levels, it is called "harmony".

702
00:35:47,976 --> 00:35:49,256
We already know

703
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:51,775
that our emotions have deviated
from the central path.

704
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:54,416
What should we do when it has
already harmed our bodies?

705
00:35:56,615 --> 00:35:58,095
There's still a way

706
00:35:58,615 --> 00:35:59,855
we can regulate our bodies.

707
00:35:59,855 --> 00:36:01,256
Next, we'll talk about

708
00:36:01,775 --> 00:36:04,775
how to regulate our unstable emotions.

709
00:36:06,496 --> 00:36:09,496
The Chinese culture relies on practice.

710
00:36:11,775 --> 00:36:12,775
Integrity needs practice.

711
00:36:14,775 --> 00:36:15,775
Morality needs to be instilled.

712
00:36:16,016 --> 00:36:19,256
If language does not transform one,

713
00:36:19,375 --> 00:36:21,095
there will be no culture.

714
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:24,192
So, what do we transform?

715
00:36:25,135 --> 00:36:25,952
What do we transform?

716
00:36:28,295 --> 00:36:29,535
Guys, what do we transform?

717
00:36:29,535 --> 00:36:31,416
We transform our negative emotions.

718
00:36:32,055 --> 00:36:34,496
If someone has negative emotions,

719
00:36:34,496 --> 00:36:36,335
you must transform them
with your actions.

720
00:36:36,976 --> 00:36:39,416
Avoiding and procrastinating

721
00:36:39,976 --> 00:36:42,135
will harm your body severely.

722
00:36:47,656 --> 00:36:49,176
I think there's an issue

723
00:36:49,176 --> 00:36:50,176
with your mindset.

724
00:36:50,176 --> 00:36:51,775
I agree with Mr Liu.

725
00:36:52,216 --> 00:36:53,375
We have to attract traffic first.

726
00:36:53,656 --> 00:36:54,456
After that,

727
00:36:54,456 --> 00:36:56,095
you can continue
with the Internet thinking.

728
00:36:56,615 --> 00:36:58,656
We'll earn money from
the surrounding businesses.

729
00:36:59,456 --> 00:37:00,615
The trading of herbs,

730
00:37:02,535 --> 00:37:03,456
online prescriptions,

731
00:37:03,696 --> 00:37:06,976
and the recommendation
between TCM and Western medicine,

732
00:37:07,535 --> 00:37:09,896
all of these will make huge money.

733
00:37:10,696 --> 00:37:12,736
The largest benefit of this academy

734
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:13,672
is that

735
00:37:13,855 --> 00:37:16,575
it'll produce batches and batches
of new talents.

736
00:37:16,696 --> 00:37:17,615
That's right.

737
00:37:18,216 --> 00:37:19,416
This is a great concept.

738
00:37:19,416 --> 00:37:20,615
If we organise it,

739
00:37:20,615 --> 00:37:22,416
it'll be a complete proposal.

740
00:37:22,535 --> 00:37:24,496
The most valuable assets
in the TCM industry

741
00:37:24,736 --> 00:37:25,535
-are its people.
-That's right.

742
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:26,976
As long as he's here,

743
00:37:27,135 --> 00:37:28,375
your industrial park

744
00:37:28,736 --> 00:37:29,736
will thrive.

745
00:37:29,736 --> 00:37:30,561
That's right.

746
00:37:33,496 --> 00:37:34,815
There's one more important point.

747
00:37:34,815 --> 00:37:36,256
We cannot talk about
the profit model first.

748
00:37:36,736 --> 00:37:37,976
Only small projects

749
00:37:38,095 --> 00:37:39,416
talk about their profit model
at the start.

750
00:37:39,855 --> 00:37:41,815
We have to talk about
visions and dreams.

751
00:37:42,055 --> 00:37:42,936
Just like Elon Musk.

752
00:37:42,936 --> 00:37:44,456
He talked about migrating to Mars
after he assumed his position.

753
00:37:44,456 --> 00:37:45,815
A world without borders.

754
00:37:46,216 --> 00:37:47,575
He made all those tycoons

755
00:37:47,575 --> 00:37:48,736
excited.

756
00:37:49,896 --> 00:37:51,176
When it comes to talking about dreams,

757
00:37:51,176 --> 00:37:52,416
Mr Liu, you're not the right fit.

758
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,580
Think about it.

759
00:37:53,615 --> 00:37:54,696
When you stand here,

760
00:37:54,696 --> 00:37:56,295
people will definitely think

761
00:37:56,295 --> 00:37:57,575
that the culture of your enterprise

762
00:37:57,936 --> 00:37:59,335
only focuses on profit,

763
00:37:59,335 --> 00:38:00,496
not dreams.

764
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,815
Professor Ren is a great fit.

765
00:38:04,216 --> 00:38:05,976
If he comes to talk about his dreams,

766
00:38:06,176 --> 00:38:07,936
everyone in the world will be convinced.

767
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,425
What about this?

768
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,176
We have a peer advisory board meeting
next month.

769
00:38:13,696 --> 00:38:14,855
You can invite Professor Ren

770
00:38:14,855 --> 00:38:15,936
to tell us

771
00:38:16,135 --> 00:38:17,416
about the vision of TCM development.

772
00:38:17,736 --> 00:38:19,815
As for the rest, we'll package them.

773
00:38:20,689 --> 00:38:23,169
This feels especially out of place.

774
00:38:23,736 --> 00:38:24,696
It's decided then.

775
00:38:26,696 --> 00:38:27,536
Let's go.

776
00:38:42,535 --> 00:38:43,936
Hello, Professor Ren?

777
00:38:44,256 --> 00:38:46,256
Today was supposed to
be your follow-up visit.

778
00:38:46,775 --> 00:38:47,736
I'm already done with my class.

779
00:38:47,855 --> 00:38:48,896
Why haven't you arrived yet?

780
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:51,736
Actually, I was there.

781
00:38:54,496 --> 00:38:55,815
(I was at the classroom's door.)

782
00:38:56,216 --> 00:38:58,055
(I heard your lesson about emotion.)

783
00:38:58,696 --> 00:39:00,335
(I was suddenly enlightened.)

784
00:39:01,176 --> 00:39:03,375
(It feels like all of my troubles
has been lifted.)

785
00:39:04,095 --> 00:39:05,736
I feel like I'm cured.

786
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,392
Congratulations then.

787
00:39:09,775 --> 00:39:10,896
Thank you, Professor Ren.

788
00:39:30,216 --> 00:39:31,088
Grandson!

789
00:39:32,656 --> 00:39:33,456
I'm here!

790
00:39:34,936 --> 00:39:35,736
Where's the skateboard?

791
00:39:37,456 --> 00:39:38,456
Wait, where's the skateboard?

792
00:39:40,936 --> 00:39:41,976
You brought nothing?

793
00:39:42,775 --> 00:39:44,375
What? Are we here to eat?

794
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,584
Today,

795
00:39:46,775 --> 00:39:48,176
you shall acknowledge me
as your master first.

796
00:39:52,615 --> 00:39:54,135
What's wrong with you guys?

797
00:39:54,936 --> 00:39:55,936
Why do you guys like

798
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:57,216
such ceremonies so much?

799
00:39:58,216 --> 00:39:59,335
Do you like it that much

800
00:39:59,335 --> 00:40:00,736
when people address you as Master?

801
00:40:00,736 --> 00:40:01,615
You're so childish.

802
00:40:02,696 --> 00:40:03,936
If you wish to travel
the pugilist world,

803
00:40:03,936 --> 00:40:05,855
you must get a famous master.

804
00:40:06,256 --> 00:40:08,095
Since I've already agreed to teach you,

805
00:40:08,176 --> 00:40:09,615
we need to make this official.

806
00:40:10,016 --> 00:40:11,256
If not, what if you...

807
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:14,216
If I do embarrass myself out there,

808
00:40:14,216 --> 00:40:15,976
I won't rat you out, okay?

809
00:40:15,976 --> 00:40:16,805
Deal.

810
00:40:20,256 --> 00:40:21,176
Deal.

811
00:40:21,936 --> 00:40:22,776
Alright.

812
00:40:24,176 --> 00:40:25,016
You're so troublesome.

813
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:26,456
What are you doing?

814
00:40:26,456 --> 00:40:28,135
We have to be particular
with the ceremony.

815
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:32,327
Look.

816
00:40:32,656 --> 00:40:35,375
This is an excellent wine that
my grandfather has kept for a long time.

817
00:40:35,615 --> 00:40:36,936
It's definitely good.

818
00:40:39,055 --> 00:40:39,895
What do you think?

819
00:40:40,936 --> 00:40:42,496
Don't you think I'm nice?

820
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:46,535
I'm sure this has a huge kick then.

821
00:40:46,696 --> 00:40:47,936
Of course.

822
00:40:49,976 --> 00:40:50,793
You can stop craving for it.

823
00:40:51,696 --> 00:40:52,496
Go ahead.

824
00:40:55,295 --> 00:40:56,159
Rebecca.

825
00:40:56,775 --> 00:40:57,600
Rebecca,

826
00:40:57,696 --> 00:40:59,295
I don't think it's appropriate

827
00:40:59,295 --> 00:41:00,375
for us to just drink yogurt

828
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:01,456
without ordering any food here.

829
00:41:02,615 --> 00:41:04,176
Can you please focus?

830
00:41:04,176 --> 00:41:05,456
My time is expensive.

831
00:41:07,656 --> 00:41:09,095
You kept playing with those threads.

832
00:41:09,095 --> 00:41:10,736
How can I focus like this?

833
00:41:14,216 --> 00:41:15,025
I'm done.

834
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,535
Does this shirt cost
tens of thousands as well

835
00:41:18,535 --> 00:41:19,416
when it looks this cheap?

836
00:41:21,656 --> 00:41:24,496
I ordered this from Taobao.

837
00:41:24,496 --> 00:41:26,055
It's meant for people
to wear to food stalls.

838
00:41:26,256 --> 00:41:27,496
It costs 55 yuan

839
00:41:27,496 --> 00:41:29,335
from top to bottom.
And, it's disposable.

840
00:41:29,456 --> 00:41:30,375
By the way,

841
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:31,855
it's 80 yuan if you include

842
00:41:32,095 --> 00:41:33,216
this disposable bottle as well.

843
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:34,896
What? You use Taobao too?

844
00:41:35,256 --> 00:41:36,696
I had no choice. You forced me to do it.

845
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:38,416
That's pretty good.

846
00:41:38,535 --> 00:41:40,335
Share the link with me later.

847
00:41:43,416 --> 00:41:44,656
By the way, I have
something to tell you.

848
00:41:44,656 --> 00:41:46,535
The Dragon Boat Festival
is a public holiday.

849
00:41:46,855 --> 00:41:48,615
Our tuition class

850
00:41:48,615 --> 00:41:49,496
will be suspended for the time being.

851
00:41:49,736 --> 00:41:50,656
But why?

852
00:41:51,055 --> 00:41:52,135
Are you going on a trip?

853
00:41:52,855 --> 00:41:54,896
I'm going to join the TCM forum.

854
00:41:55,256 --> 00:41:56,696
But your name wasn't included

855
00:41:56,696 --> 00:41:57,535
in the name list.

856
00:41:57,696 --> 00:41:59,295
Besides, people won't invite

857
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:01,016
half-baked physicians like us.

858
00:42:01,016 --> 00:42:02,016
This time,

859
00:42:02,535 --> 00:42:05,176
I'm going there because
the organiser invited me.

860
00:42:05,696 --> 00:42:07,535
What gives?
Why didn't he invite me then?

861
00:42:07,896 --> 00:42:10,176
The organiser is an

862
00:42:10,176 --> 00:42:11,135
old client of mine.

863
00:42:11,135 --> 00:42:13,335
I'm going there to visit him mainly.

864
00:42:13,335 --> 00:42:15,095
I'm just joining the forum
since I'll be there anyway.

865
00:42:16,775 --> 00:42:19,176
I think you're just going there
to join the forum.

866
00:42:20,176 --> 00:42:21,135
Take me with you.

867
00:42:22,016 --> 00:42:23,375
A spy like me

868
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:25,656
needs to head to the enemy's nest
to eradicate them once and for all.

869
00:42:27,176 --> 00:42:28,216
Take me with you.

870
00:42:28,216 --> 00:42:29,095
You're a renowned figure.

871
00:42:29,095 --> 00:42:30,656
You need to have a servant beside you.

872
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:32,456
Besides,

873
00:42:32,936 --> 00:42:34,615
the mountain path is rugged and uneven.

874
00:42:35,176 --> 00:42:36,216
I checked the schedule too.

875
00:42:36,216 --> 00:42:37,016
We have to gather mugwort

876
00:42:37,016 --> 00:42:37,936
in the mountains before dawn
on the second day.

877
00:42:37,936 --> 00:42:39,375
I'm sure you'll depart at night.

878
00:42:39,375 --> 00:42:40,736
What if you encounter a bear

879
00:42:40,736 --> 00:42:42,775
or a robber? It'll be dangerous.

880
00:42:43,496 --> 00:42:44,696
Most importantly,

881
00:42:46,216 --> 00:42:47,176
it's a long journey.

882
00:42:47,216 --> 00:42:49,615
You need a second driver somehow.

883
00:42:56,862 --> 00:42:58,071
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

884
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,006
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

885
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,897
(Do not use without medical advice)
