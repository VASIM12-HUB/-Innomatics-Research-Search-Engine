Look at you two syncing up.

26
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,220
If people didn't know, they'd think you guys had been living together for tens of years.

27
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,920
Mom! Can you stop always saying weird things?

28
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,910
What did I say?

29
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,660
You're the one who's overthinking it.

30
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,880
When are you going to leave? You said you were staying for one night, it's now the second night.

31
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,190
Okay, okay. I got it.

32
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,930
Little Gu isn't even kicking me out, why has it come for you to kick me out?

33
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,240
Right, Little Gu?

34
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,680
Yeah.

35
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,280
This one looks good.

36
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,540
- Morning. 
- Morning.

37
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,420
Eat, eat.

38
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,290
Here, have a bun. Here.

39
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,150
Are you two not in a hurry today?

40
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,700
I'm going back to school today to discuss my graduation thesis with my professor.

41
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,450
I'm going back to school, too.

42
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,350
- Then, are the two of you going together? 
 - Yeah.

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,270
What is it?

44
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:43,860
Nothing. Your reply was too natural.

45
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,430
Why are you going back to school? What about your experiment in the old school district?

46
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,020
Professor Jiang is in the new school district right now. I have something to discuss with him.

47
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,750
Is that so?

48
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,190
- Do you still listen to comedy sketches? 
- What?

49
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,540
Do you still listen to comedy sketches?

50
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,630
These days, I've been really busy.  I forgot to download the new ones.

51
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,280
I downloaded them.

52
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,970
Thank you to everyone for the warm and enthusiastic applause.

53
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,030
Thank you.

54
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,040
There are people who know us and there are those who don't know us.

55
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,110
Let's introduce ourselves.

56
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,020
My name is Yue Yunpeng.

57
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,620
I'll do a part with him.

58
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,360
- What do you mean, "with him?" 
 - What's wrong?

59
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,570
You haven't even said what my name is.

60
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,160
Surprise!

61
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,180
- Mo Mo. 
- You scared us to death. 
 - You scared us to death.

62
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,640
You're being so suspicious. What are you doing?

63
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,760
Today, the supervisor is going to check our high power electrical appliances.

64
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,930
Then just put them where they originally were.

65
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,850
The small room at the end of the corridor has already been discovered.

66
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,200
What? Then what are you going to do?

67
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,660
I'm planning to hide the pot inside the dirty laundry.

68
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,500
She definitely won't even want to touch it. Then I would have hidden from it all.

69
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,660
How long has it been since you've washed those socks?

70
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,290
Meng Lu asked her boyfriend for them. Her boyfriend

71
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,000
asked for a bunch from his dorm.

72
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,430
What are you doing?

73
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,350
Cleaning up.

74
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,510
You're hiding a pot, aren't you?

75
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,020
No, no!

76
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,500
The two of us were gathering dirty clothes to take them to wash.

77
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,740
What is that?

78
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,610
Dirty clothes.

79
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,670
Let go.

80
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,110
Supervisor, the clothes are really dirty! They haven't been washed in two weeks!

81
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:48,390
It's right if they're dirty. The dorms' hygiene and tidiness are also part of the things that are being checked.

82
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:01,720
Are you that hungry? You're even boiling socks to eat?

83
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,310
Come and get your pot back from me after you graduate.

84
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,530
I–

85
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,550
Supervisor.

86
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,930
I was so scared.

87
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,650
Auntie. Auntie! Hello.

88
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:35,500
I don't do gym, I'm not signing up for cards, I'm not buying supplements.

89
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:40,430
No, I'm Situ Mo's high school classmate. My name is Fu Pei. Do you still remember me?

90
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,430
Maybe I'm getting old, so I don't really remember.

91
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:49,910
I even went to your house before to give Mo Mo her report card. You even invited me to eat walnuts.

92
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,460
A waste of my walnuts.

93
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,420
- What did you say? 
 - Huh? Oh.

94
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,880
I–I didn't say anything. I was saying, that I should go home to cook dinner. Let's talk next time.

95
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,490
- Let's talk next time. 
 - Mom! Who are you talking with?

96
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,420
You're back?

97
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:12,270
You're back! Let's go. I'll make soup for you, quickly.

98
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,330
Auntie.

99
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:18,050
Student, we have to go home for dinner. You should go home quickly as well.

100
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,690
Auntie!

101
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,290
It was that Fu Pei, right?

102
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:40,760
The one from secondary school. There was once when you came home,

103
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,170
you secretly locked yourself in your room and cried the whole night.

104
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,920
That Fu Pei that was written all over in your diary.

105
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,920
Mom, why did you read my diary?

106
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,720
But you cried all night.

107
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,930
You scared me and your dad so much that we didn't sleep a wink.

108
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,030
Do you have to be so exaggerated?

109
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,600
I thought you two stopped being in contact with each other a long time ago.

110
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,030
I don't want to be in contact with him either.

111
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:09,740
Mo Mo, actually, ever since you were young, you've been more mature than your older sister and younger brother.

112
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:14,760
You didn't like crying, you liked doing everything by yourself.

113
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:20,140
But during that time, you became depressed for a really long time because of him.

114
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:24,690
Yet, you pretended that nothing happened on the outside. We also didn't dare to ask.

115
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,230
Do you know how awful we felt back then?

116
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,990
Mo Mo, your dad and I, towards you three kids,

117
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,960
don't have too many big expectations.

118
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,540
We also don't expect you guys to achieve anything great.

119
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,970
We just hope you guys can live happily.

120
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:52,300
That Fu Pei... I tried to get to know him.

121
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,570
He's not a bad kid, he just doesn't have a determined nature.

122
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:01,030
If the two of you really got together, with your personality,

123
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:05,830
wouldn't you keep your thoughts all bottled up inside you and sacrifice yourself for the bigger picture (accept compromises)?

124
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,530
Mo Mo, don't accept compromises.

125
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,500
You can't do that, that won't do.

126
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,420
Mom.

127
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,490
Okay, okay. Let's not talk about him anymore.

128
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:22,220
Then, I'll tell you some good news.

129
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,390
What good news?

130
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,760
I'm going home tomorrow. I've packed my luggage.

131
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,990
You keep trying to kick me out every day.

132
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,340
As if I'm forcing you and Little Gu to do something.

133
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,770
Mom, I'm not kicking you out.

134
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,840
All right, all right. Do you think I don't get your personality?

135
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,460
Okay, I won't manage you anymore.

136
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:49,180
In the future, you can do as you see fit. Okay?

137
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,760
This guy is so stupid. You better not find someone like him.

138
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,440
I got it.

139
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:09,460
This girl is dumb as well. You better not be like her, got it?

140
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,170
- I got it. 
 - So dumb.

141
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:20,960
Auntie, I'm back.

142
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,760
Little Gu, you're back. Come and sit.

143
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,380
Have you had dinner?

144
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,650
I have.

145
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,820
- Hi. 
- Hi.

146
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:35,360
I wanted to say something to you.

147
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,520
Auntie is going back home tomorrow.

148
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:43,290
I hope you can keep taking care of our Mo Mo.

149
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,670
Okay, Auntie. You're welcome to come visit often.

150
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,120
Okay, okay, okay.

151
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,210
All right. Then, you guys stay seated. I'll go cut two oranges for you.

152
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,060
Gu Weiyi, aren't you really smart?

153
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,180
How about you write my graduation thesis for me?

154
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:22,450
Forget it. Different fields are separated as if by mountains. You wouldn't understand even if I told you.

155
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,330
What's the topic of your thesis?

156
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,340
You'll be scared to death if I tell you my thesis topic.

157
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,190
I'm prepared to meet death.

158
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:37,380
The joining of accounting and information in small and medium-sized enterprises and the study of cloud computing based accounting models.

159
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,450
Do you feel absolutely baffled just by hearing it?

160
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,250
What's the topic of your graduation thesis?

161
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,030
Improvements in Experimental Methods in Determining the Average Molecular Weight of Ethenol by Viscosity Method.

162
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,440
Oh, oh... Sorry for disturbing you.

163
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,530
Is your thesis not going well?

164
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,050
I got scolded by my adviser.

165
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:01,350
They said that my thesis lacks originality and that my argument is unclear.

166
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,130
They can't tell what profound thoughts I have on the future of accounting.

167
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:08,060
What thoughts do I have? I don't even know if I will be doing accounting in the future.

168
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,060
Then, what do you want to do?

169
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,260
Advertising.

170
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,520

00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:02,170
Bye-bye.

How was the interview?

344
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,650
It should be about right. They asked me when I could start working.

345
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:16,100
- Then, let's go. 
 - Let's go.

00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:23,980
I'm going back.

00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,430

 - Okay.

[You've left something, how about...]

350
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:22,160
You really want to get inside the building to sell your products, don't you?

351
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,350
I'm not a salesman.

352
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:27,650
Are you sure? You've been standing there with your flyers for quite some time now.

353
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,190
Are you new in sales?

354
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:33,610
I've been working here for so many years. I can tell what you want to do here straight away.

355
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:35,150
Hurry up and go away.

356
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:38,010
Auntie, I'm really not a salesman.

Pei Lan.

358
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,970
Wait for a moment. I just caught a salesman.

359
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:47,770
- What? Where? 
- Right here.

360
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:52,450
He's a student of mine. He's Gu Weiyi. He's not a salesman.

361
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,580
- Your student? 
- Yes.

362
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,120
But he's holding...

363
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,120
Draft papers?

364
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,650
You bunch of bookworms... I really don't understand what's going on in your mind all day.

365
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:07,390
Why are you still indirectly scolding me?

366
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,230
All right, hurry up and get away from here.

367
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:12,770
A big-grown boy like you hanging around in front of the female dorms all day long...

368
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:15,530
No wonder I thought you were a salesman.

369
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:17,920
Fine. Let's go, Little Gu.

370
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:20,660
Pei Lan, how about we...

371
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:24,950
There is no "we." Have you realized your mistake?

372
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:29,030
Yes.

373
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,720
Say it louder.

374
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,370
I realized my mistake.

375
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:35,130
Will you smoke behind my back again?

376
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,750
No. I won't.

377
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,980
You're not sincere at all.

378
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:43,450
Hurry up and give me the key. I'm in a rush to get some files from the house.

379
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,620
I'm leaving.

380
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:50,560
Little Gu, go home, okay?

381
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,000
Auntie, you and Professor Jiang...

382
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,880
He's my significant other.

383
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,220
I've finally finished my thesis!

384
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,440
I really just want to curse.

00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,890
Congratulations!

386
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:38,990
At this moment, I, Situ Mo, want to dedicate my thesis to--

387
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:42,130
Gu Weiyi. Hello?

388
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:44,230
Situ Mo, come back home now.

389
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,660
Home? What home?

390
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,980
My home.

391
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,000
Why?

392
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,720
Your mom says she's coming over.

393
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,490
What? You didn't tell her that I moved out, did you?

394
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,640
I didn't.

395
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,860
Okay, stall her. I'll be there soon.

396
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,460
Hurry up, I'll do my best.

397
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,370
Okay, bye-bye.

398
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,680
Oh crap!

399
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:13,870
What are you doing?

400
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:18,310
I told you before. My mom keeps wanting to set me up with Gu Weiyi. She keeps forcing me to live with him.

401
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:20,970
Gu Weiyi just told me that my mom is coming over to check up on us.

402
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:24,650
I need to rush back and pretend that I never moved out.

403
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:28,440
How about... I go with you?

404
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:33,650
I'm just curious about what the house of the physics genius would look like.

405
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:37,050
You said it looked like a mortuary, right?

406
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:42,560
Also, if you bring a friend home with you, your mom will be more likely to believe that you've lived there for a long time.

407
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,820
Maybe she won't do a spot check again.

408
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:49,330
Makes sense. Hurry up and pack things up.

409
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,730
Hello, I'm Momo's roommate, Wang Shan.

410
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:43,880
She's my friend Wang Shan.

411
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,930
- Hello.
 - Where's my mom?

412
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:49,800
- She just said that she wasn't coming. 
 - What?

413
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,090
Why?

414
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:54,020
Someone scheduled to play Mahjong with her.

415
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,540
No way. She's playing around with me again?

416
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,850
You can call her up and ask.

417
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:01,110
Forget about it.

418
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:05,170
If there's nothing going on, we'll be leaving then.

419
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:08,090
Wait for a moment. Someone is coming in a bit.

420
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,400
Who?

421
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,690
You'll know soon enough.

422
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:15,390
Open the door.

423
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,800
Let's celebrate with Mo Mo for finally finishing her thesis!

424
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:36,760
We have to celebrate well for Mo Mo today. You don't mind if we make a mess at your place, do you?

425
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,480
What if I say I do?

426
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,350
Then, you're being too stingy.

427
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:43,130
Is there any drink you want? We have some beer,

428
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:46,460
juice, and soda.

429
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,890
I'll have a beer.

430
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,680
Mo Mo shouldn't drink beer.

431
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,170
What is he doing here again?

432
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,200
You have so many movies here.

433
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:16,070
Why are they all horror?

434
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:20,300
Let's... watch a movie.

435
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,120
The old lady wasn't human.

436
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,730
Has she gone away?

437
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,190
She's gone.

438
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,590
He'll eat the candle later.

439
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:57,700
Please stop talking...

440
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,120
Why did you stop talking?

441
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,600
- You told me not to talk. 
 - So you stopped talking just because I said so?

442
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,040
So do I talk or not?

443
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,920
I don't know either.

444
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,270
Why aren't there any tomato flavored ones?

445
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:33,340
They were all sold out.

446
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:36,190
- I'll go and... 
 - No need.

447
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:39,670
- I was just saying.
 - Are you scared now?

448
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,560
You were forced to stay together because of your mom, right?

449
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,260
Yes. What's wrong?

450
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,420
Why didn't you tell me last time?

451
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,780
What's there to tell? You're not my boyfriend.

452
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,830
Where are you going?

453
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:06,290
I suddenly remembered we had tomato flavored chips in the house.

454
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:34,350
Fu Pei. Fu Pei. Fu Pei!

455
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,120
I'm fine.

456
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,530
I'm fine.

457
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,490
I'll get him a glass of water.

458
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,910
Situ Mo, come here and help me find the honey.

459
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,620
Fu Pei, are you all right?

460
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:30,270
Let's go home.

461
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,720
Mo Mo.

462
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:43,540
Fu Pei. Fu Pei, you've drunk too much.

463
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:48,790
[To be continued... There are still easter eggs]

Hello? Little Gu? Is Mo Mo doing well so far?

465
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,800
She's doing pretty well.

466
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,200
I sent you guys something several days ago.

467
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,880
It should be arriving today. Remember to check for it, okay?

468
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,030
Okay, Auntie.

469
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:31,860
If Mo Mo bullies you, you can tell Auntie. I'll scold her.

470
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,730
