No way.

22
00:02:27,227 --> 00:02:29,140
You prepared all these?

23
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,832
Sit down.

00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,859
Good.

27

Is it delicious? Is it delicious?

29
00:02:55,734 --> 00:02:57,236
- It's delicious.
- Really?

30
00:02:57,236 --> 00:02:58,786
Really.

00:03:01,131 --> 00:03:03,468
Let me get you a bowl of soup.

00:03:08,423 --> 00:03:09,972
Just a minor injury.

33
00:03:09,972 --> 00:03:10,801

34
00:03:10,801 --> 00:03:12,263
Really just a minor injury.

Be obedient.

36
00:03:16,623 --> 00:03:19,976

You don't have to.

No, it doesn't.

Xiarui. How can you just refuse like this?

00:04:19,448 --> 00:04:21,296
Although it's quite cool this way.

48
00:04:21,296 --> 00:04:23,548
But you should have discussed with us.

49

What's there to discuss?

50
00:04:26,152 --> 00:04:28,912
I think it's not about
what to discuss.

51
00:04:28,912 --> 00:04:30,956
Because of Nanxi, you give up your dream.

Isn't this stupid?

53

isn't that a good thing too?

He left Binhai a long time ago.

Okay. I know that you all care about me.

Not like I'm giving up on making coffee.

Moreover, our Boss Yi
is as good as Wang Wei To.

Don't tell Nanxi about this.

has a design competition.

Don't disturb him at this time.
He is troubled.

76
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,392
Didn't Nanxi go to Jiangzhou to find you?

77
00:05:35,392 --> 00:05:37,420
Why didn't you both came back together?

78

You're talking about the

that will be held soon?

114
00:07:37,742 --> 00:07:38,614
Correct.

115
00:07:38,614 --> 00:07:39,452
Yes.

116
00:07:39,452 --> 00:07:44,648
Our school established a cooperation with
their School of Architecture.

get our college qualification,

like in the previous years

119

But now he/she can also go to Milan
as an exchange student for a year.

120
00:07:52,835 --> 00:07:55,051
And you have to ensure that
during your third year of studies

121
00:07:55,051 --> 00:07:59,345
you have to come back for the graduation
project and graduation thesis report.

Didn't you always reject the competition?

Why all of a sudden,
you changed your mind?

126

we have to face lots of new things.

new environment. And a bunch of people

want that because of me--

That was the coffee Xiarui
made during the rematch.

00:09:11,156 --> 00:09:13,984
I'm ready to sell it at our shop.

149
00:09:13,984 --> 00:09:15,198
Let everyone taste it.

150
00:09:15,198 --> 00:09:17,103
Isn't it little whale?

151
00:09:17,103 --> 00:09:20,693
Why is it that little whale met big whale?

152
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:24,384
You have to ask our Xiarui.

153
00:09:24,384 --> 00:09:27,467
This is too much.
I need a cup of coffee too.

154
00:09:27,492 --> 00:09:31,151
The best would be Chinese herbs flavour.
Just needs to be bitter, nothing else.

155
00:09:35,607 --> 00:09:37,573
It seems like coffee can no
longer neutralize me.

Why not...

159
00:09:45,408 --> 00:09:47,030
You are hiding something from me again?

160
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,551
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

Delicious.

165
00:10:06,854 --> 00:10:10,962
Not bad. Let's call it a day.

166
00:10:10,962 --> 00:10:13,547
Sure, let's stop here today.

167
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,604
Si bo. I have a question.

168
00:10:18,604 --> 00:10:19,791
Always wanted to ask you.

169
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,448
Say it.
There are 14 people in our team.

170
00:10:22,448 --> 00:10:24,755
They are pretty talented too.

171
00:10:24,755 --> 00:10:26,391
Why do you have so much confidence in me?

172
00:10:26,391 --> 00:10:29,999
And are willing to spare time
training in school with me?

173
00:10:32,974 --> 00:10:36,580
This question
is not easy to answer.

174
00:10:42,153 --> 00:10:45,053
Shu. How did you know that
I just finished my training?

175
00:10:45,053 --> 00:10:47,082
Have a meal?

176
00:10:47,082 --> 00:10:49,401
No problem.
Then wait for me.

177
00:10:49,401 --> 00:10:50,943
- Shu?
- Yes.

178
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:52,684
Asking to have dinner together tonight.

179
00:10:52,684 --> 00:10:55,453
Si Bo,
Let's go together tonight.

180
00:10:55,453 --> 00:10:57,789
If you guys are having dinner,
I won't be joining.

181
00:10:57,789 --> 00:11:00,062
No, I've always wanted to
invite you to have dinner together.

182
00:11:00,062 --> 00:11:01,998
It's not easy to pick a date, right?

183
00:11:01,998 --> 00:11:03,675
Moreover, Shu is not an outsider, right?

184
00:11:03,675 --> 00:11:06,134
You know Nanxi too.

185
00:11:07,415 --> 00:11:09,803
- Nanxi is going as well?
- Probably?

186
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:11,783
We've made an appointment to
have dinner together since lunch.

187
00:11:11,783 --> 00:11:14,287
To celebrate Nanxi, signing up for
the design competition.

188
00:11:14,287 --> 00:11:15,554
Nanxi already signed up?

189
00:11:15,554 --> 00:11:16,642
That's right.

190
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:19,032
Why did he change his
mind all of a sudden?

191
00:11:19,032 --> 00:11:22,553
Si Bo. It's either you ask Nanxi.
Or you just follow me.

192
00:11:22,553 --> 00:11:27,089
I will tell you about it when we
are on the way. Let's go I'm so hungry.

193
00:11:31,977 --> 00:11:35,016
Cheng Erluo. Practice went well today.

194
00:11:35,016 --> 00:11:36,183
Just that.

195
00:11:36,183 --> 00:11:38,589
The moment when you turn around.
You have to be fast.

196
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:40,112
- The step where my body turns?
- Right.

197
00:11:40,112 --> 00:11:42,975
And when I'm backing up your shot

198
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,826
you must pay attention on--

199
00:11:48,326 --> 00:11:49,514
Si Bo. What happened during the shot?

200
00:11:49,539 --> 00:11:50,900
What happened during the shot?

201
00:11:52,114 --> 00:11:54,544
You guys are eating here?

202
00:11:54,544 --> 00:11:56,396
Yes.
I have never been here before.

203
00:11:56,396 --> 00:11:58,492
But it looks pretty good.

204
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,924
Why?
Si Bo, have you been here before?

205
00:12:00,924 --> 00:12:02,816
Once or twice.

206
00:12:02,816 --> 00:12:05,488
Wherever you have been once or twice.
It should taste good.

207
00:12:05,488 --> 00:12:07,690
Let's go.

208
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,464
I'm not going.

209
00:12:09,464 --> 00:12:11,664
Shu could be waiting for you.

210
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:15,399
Cheng Erluo. I can answer your question now.

211
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:17,391
The reason why I'm helping
you out with your practice.

212
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:20,371
Not just hoping that you could
achieve good results in the C.U.B.A.

213
00:12:20,371 --> 00:12:24,780
I also hope.
You can be a better Cheng Erluo.

214
00:12:25,863 --> 00:12:27,388
Thank you, Si Bo.

215
00:12:27,388 --> 00:12:29,484
I will definitely work hard.

216
00:12:31,296 --> 00:12:32,511
Keep it up.

217
00:12:32,511 --> 00:12:35,889
Are you really not going to eat?

218
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,354
Go.

219
00:12:37,354 --> 00:12:38,220
Go ahead.

220
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,380
Then I'm going.

221
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,749
Keep it up.

222
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,648
Shu. Why are you alone?

223
00:12:49,648 --> 00:12:51,301
Where is Xiarui?

224
00:12:51,301 --> 00:12:53,678
Xiarui and Nanxi have
something going on tonight.

225
00:12:53,678 --> 00:12:55,656
It's just the two of us.

226
00:12:56,628 --> 00:12:59,184
If I'd knew I would have
brought Si Bo along.

227
00:12:59,184 --> 00:13:01,240
The more people the merrier it is,
isn't it?

228
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,223
Did you see he was at the doorstep,
but turned around and left.

229
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,468
Did he mention why?

230
00:13:07,468 --> 00:13:10,253
He did not. He just left.

231
00:13:10,253 --> 00:13:12,168
Quite suddenly.

232
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:16,320
Maybe he had something all of a sudden.

233
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,656
He must be unlucky.

234
00:13:18,656 --> 00:13:20,956
Because this place seems good.

235
00:13:20,956 --> 00:13:22,976
Not like where Xiarui always brings us.

236
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:24,953
It's either skewer or the food stall.

237
00:13:24,953 --> 00:13:26,748
I smell like lamb skewer.

238
00:13:26,748 --> 00:13:29,950
Our Shu knows how to pick a good place.

239
00:13:32,234 --> 00:13:34,349
Cheng Erluo.

240
00:13:34,349 --> 00:13:36,002
I...

241
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:41,096
Actually, today I want to tell you...

242
00:13:50,109 --> 00:13:53,328
Why are you so nervous?

243
00:13:53,328 --> 00:13:55,960
Do you want to say something?

244
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:01,067
Is it…
The same thing that I'm guessing?

245
00:14:02,443 --> 00:14:04,482
Guess what?

246
00:14:04,482 --> 00:14:06,618
Isn't it just a meal?

247
00:14:06,618 --> 00:14:09,981
My treat.
Leave it to me.

248
00:14:15,532 --> 00:14:18,538
- Actually I...
- Actually I have a lot that

249
00:14:19,369 --> 00:14:21,325
I want to tell you.

250
00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:24,086
You first.

251
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:28,076
Si Bo has been helping
me with my practice recently?

252
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:31,007
A long time has passed.
Actually, he's quite nice.

253
00:14:31,007 --> 00:14:33,723
Like just now.
Do you know what he said to me?

254
00:14:33,723 --> 00:14:35,738
What did he say?

255
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:40,403
I hope you can become a
better Cheng Erluo.

256
00:14:41,152 --> 00:14:42,855
You know how touched I was?

257
00:14:42,855 --> 00:14:45,208
It's like the line of the idol
drama male lead.

258
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:48,776
If I were a girl I would have
fallen in love with him on the spot.

259
00:14:48,776 --> 00:14:50,526
- Shu.
- I've thought about it for a long time.

260
00:14:50,526 --> 00:14:52,920
This Si Bo usually
takes care of you.

261
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,382
If two of you have any misunderstanding

262
00:14:54,382 --> 00:14:56,851
I, Cheng Erluo
will untie it all by myself.

263
00:14:56,851 --> 00:15:01,323
Our boat of friendship can't
just turn over like that.

264
00:15:01,323 --> 00:15:02,687
Friendship.

265
00:15:02,687 --> 00:15:05,358
Yeah!
You see, look at me, how tough I am.

266
00:15:05,415 --> 00:15:07,078
Si Bo is my good brother.

267
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:10,074
If there's something unhappy
between you two.

268
00:15:10,074 --> 00:15:12,195
I'm between the both of you.

269
00:15:12,195 --> 00:15:14,160
It's very hard for me.

270
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,975
Cheng Erluo.

271
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:18,610
Are we just friends?

272
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,593
Of course not.

273
00:15:21,593 --> 00:15:22,610
Best friends.

274
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:23,862
Buddies.

275
00:15:23,862 --> 00:15:24,889
Bestie.

276
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:27,044
Whichever it is.

277
00:15:36,355 --> 00:15:40,758
What did you want to tell me?

278
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:48,087
Nothing. I'm not feeling well.

279
00:15:48,102 --> 00:15:49,725
I'll go first.

280
00:15:49,725 --> 00:15:51,801
Are you okay?

281
00:15:51,801 --> 00:15:54,392
Waiter, pack it up, pack it up!

282
00:15:54,392 --> 00:15:56,271
Shu.

283
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:03,496
Come in.

284
00:16:06,845 --> 00:16:09,872
Why did you finish your meal this early?

285
00:16:09,872 --> 00:16:11,807
How was it ?
Did you tell Cheng Erluo?

286
00:16:11,807 --> 00:16:14,848
Is he very excited?
Until he couldn't speak a word?

287
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:18,289
I... didn't say anything.

288
00:16:18,289 --> 00:16:21,290
Why?
Come in first.

289
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:26,800
Sit.

290
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,629
Why?

291
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:33,857
I knew you would ask me, so I came
here immediately from the restaurant.

292
00:16:33,857 --> 00:16:36,744
What happened? Tell me.

293
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:39,752
I think

294
00:16:40,548 --> 00:16:43,591
Cheng Erluo doesn't want
to be in a relationship right now.

295
00:16:43,591 --> 00:16:46,406
I think I have to reconsider
our relationship.

296
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:48,550
Think? About what?

297
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,043
Did he bully you?
I'll teach him a lesson for you!

298
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,368
Please don't, Xiarui.

299
00:16:53,368 --> 00:16:56,428
I came here just to tell you…

300
00:16:56,861 --> 00:17:01,437
if you see him, please
don't tell him about this.

301
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,720
And don't tell Nanxi either.

302
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,408
Are you sure about this?

303
00:17:11,308 --> 00:17:13,466
Growing up

304
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:16,959
I've been taken care of and
had everything organized by my parents.

305
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,631
Even had you protecting me at school.

306
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,917
My life seems a bit too smooth.

307
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,760
So smooth that I don't know what I like,

308
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,030
that I don't know what life has given me.

309
00:17:31,855 --> 00:17:36,220
But whether if it's yours or
what you have in life, it's all yours.

310
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:38,970
It's not the same.

311
00:17:39,746 --> 00:17:45,116
Just like how I grew up with
mom and dad behind the stage.

312
00:17:45,116 --> 00:17:48,781
Like I should be an actor without a doubt.

313
00:17:48,781 --> 00:17:51,690
Cheng Erluo has been by my
side since childhood.

314
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:55,419
I seem to have fallen for him,
as if it was the right thing to do.

315
00:17:55,419 --> 00:17:59,709
Today he asked me, do we
even need to explain our relationship?

316
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:02,807
I was a little unclear at that time.

317
00:18:02,807 --> 00:18:07,418
Do I like him, or am I used to him?

318
00:18:07,418 --> 00:18:11,188
So I think I should think about it now.

319
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:16,313
But about what it? Of course you like him.

320
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:20,334
I hope so.

321
00:18:21,265 --> 00:18:23,254
Xiarui, I'm back.

322
00:18:24,425 --> 00:18:26,670
I better be going.

323
00:18:27,887 --> 00:18:29,620
Promise me, don't say anything.

324
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,840
Oke, I won't.

325
00:18:30,872 --> 00:18:33,086
- Okay.
- Nanxi, I'm leaving now.

326
00:18:33,086 --> 00:18:35,638
- Okay.
- Bye bye.

327
00:18:35,638 --> 00:18:37,390
Don't need to send me out.

328
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,375
What happened to Zhao Yishu?

329
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,895
She was…
Erm, nothing.

330
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:50,720
Are you tired today?

331
00:18:51,283 --> 00:18:52,808
A little.

332
00:18:57,948 --> 00:18:59,378
What?

333
00:19:01,864 --> 00:19:03,403
Why?

334
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,563
Exhausted?

335
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:18,295
Nanxi.

336
00:19:18,295 --> 00:19:21,579
Don't move. Let me hug you for a while.

337
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,423
Why? Are you using me as a charger?

338
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,336
Recovering blood and charge.

339
00:19:28,336 --> 00:19:30,696
Shu was right.

340
00:19:30,696 --> 00:19:33,520
You boys are childish.

341
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,097
Yes.

342
00:19:35,097 --> 00:19:36,897
Yes, indeed.

343
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:39,688
Xiarui.

344
00:19:39,688 --> 00:19:41,748
Are you tired from memorizing vocabulary?

345
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:44,912
Not tired.
I want to try my best.

346
00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:32,164
Hand in hand. One step, two steps
three four steps, looking at the sky.

347
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:37,792
Looking at the stars
alligning into a line.

348
00:20:40,987 --> 00:20:43,556
Shut up! Don't move!

349
00:20:52,782 --> 00:20:55,495
Yufei!
It's me! It's me!

350
00:20:55,495 --> 00:20:57,336
Yang Yufei!

351
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:02,004
Yufei, I didn't mean to yell at you.

352
00:21:02,797 --> 00:21:05,827
It's okay now, okay?

353
00:21:05,827 --> 00:21:07,926
I'm here.

354
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:12,942
- Don't go. Don't go!
- I won't go, I won't go.

355
00:21:12,942 --> 00:21:15,020
I will not go. I'll just be here.

356
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,050
I'll stay with you.

357
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,966
I'm not going anywhere.

358
00:21:20,911 --> 00:21:23,896
Erm, give me your phone.

359
00:21:32,102 --> 00:21:35,496
This… is my number.

360
00:21:35,496 --> 00:21:37,614
If you are going home alone
in the future, you just call me.

361
00:21:37,614 --> 00:21:39,560
I will go with you, okay?

362
00:21:39,616 --> 00:21:41,688
I'll always be with you.

363
00:21:43,698 --> 00:21:45,950
You are

364
00:21:46,516 --> 00:21:48,412
my friend.

365
00:21:48,412 --> 00:21:51,497
I, Binzi won't let anyone bully my friend.

366
00:21:55,066 --> 00:21:56,967
It's okay.

367
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:01,343
Are you feeling better?

368
00:22:02,434 --> 00:22:04,436
Then I'll take you back.

369
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,155
Let's go.

370
00:22:11,287 --> 00:22:14,613
Come.
I'll drive you home.

371
00:22:21,346 --> 00:22:23,588
You can hold on to my clothes.

372
00:22:26,321 --> 00:22:28,060
Let's go.

373
00:22:31,233 --> 00:22:33,923
If you can't sit still then just
put your hands on me.

374
00:22:33,923 --> 00:22:36,145
Rest assured.
I don't mean to take advantage of you.

375
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:39,140
I just think it's too dark,
I'm afraid to knock you off.

376
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:43,020
Actually today, I should've
sent that kid to the police station.

377
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,677
I'm telling you.
Not that I'm bragging.

378
00:22:45,677 --> 00:22:48,452
What Ermei clan, Wudang clan,
Huashan clan?

379
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:50,540
I have no problem taking them down.

380
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,828
Ermei?
Isn't Ermei a female clan?

381
00:22:53,828 --> 00:22:57,112
Doesn't matter male or female clan,
it's all written in the novels.

382
00:22:57,112 --> 00:23:01,074
As long as you can beat bad guys,
catch thieves, then it's a good clan.

383
00:23:02,331 --> 00:23:04,424
I'm fine, thank you.

384
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,950
I was just a little scared earlier.

385
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,614
Yufei, don't worry.

386
00:23:08,614 --> 00:23:11,179
You don't need to be scared as long
as I'm here. And don't be too moved.

387
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:13,615
I'm simply a very righteous person.

388
00:23:16,681 --> 00:23:21,384
Then…
Mr. righteous Egg Yolk Clan Schoolmate.

389
00:23:21,384 --> 00:23:25,547
If you drive at this speed,
I'm not going to reach the dorm in time.

390
00:23:25,547 --> 00:23:27,851
I'm just afraid you'll fall.

391
00:23:27,851 --> 00:23:31,034
Or your bike couldn't speed up?

392
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:33,120
I really hate people provoking me!

393
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,100
Speeding up!

394
00:23:44,563 --> 00:23:47,263
Your school is quite big.

395
00:23:47,263 --> 00:23:49,764
University students are pretty happy.

396
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:54,532
Liubin, let me ask you a question.

397
00:23:55,353 --> 00:23:59,228
Have you ever thought of taking the
university entrance exam again?

398
00:24:00,852 --> 00:24:04,435
Forget it. I definitely can't.
Forget it. Forget it.

399
00:24:04,435 --> 00:24:06,738
I remember your results

400
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:08,864
were only slightly lower than Xiarui's.

401
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:14,422
That means, you're only this close
to getting into Binhai Business School.

402
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,552
How did you know my exam results?

403
00:24:17,552 --> 00:24:21,351
Aren't our results on the ChengHua Board?

404
00:24:21,351 --> 00:24:24,408
I just simply took a look.
Just good memory.

405
00:24:24,408 --> 00:24:27,836
Then, do you want me
to go to Binhai Business School?

406
00:24:27,836 --> 00:24:30,803
Well how about you? Do you want to go?

407
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:34,908
I'm lying if I say I don't want to.
Also when I was working at Yami,

408
00:24:34,908 --> 00:24:37,708
most of the customers over
there are university students.

409
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:40,331
I was quite envious when
I heard them talking about the school.

410
00:24:40,331 --> 00:24:44,010
It is the taste of failing. So painful.
I don't want to experience it again.

411
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:46,025
Actually you have many strengths.

412
00:24:46,025 --> 00:24:48,160
You just didn't realize it yourself.

413
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:53,000
You are meticulous, patient,
quick minded as well.

414
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,155
So if you want to do it,
it can be done.

415
00:24:58,248 --> 00:24:59,984
Are those words really describing me?

416
00:24:59,984 --> 00:25:02,952
From other people's mouth,
I'm a bad student.

417
00:25:02,952 --> 00:25:05,811
Love to fight. Grumpy.
Explosive.

418
00:25:05,811 --> 00:25:07,283
That's not explosive.

419
00:25:07,283 --> 00:25:10,520
That's righteousness.
You are sentimental.

420
00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:14,940
So you think I can?

421
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,999
Yes, I think you can.

422
00:25:19,675 --> 00:25:21,263
We're here.

423
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:25,800
Thank you for sending me home today.

424
00:25:26,306 --> 00:25:29,036
-Bye.
-Hey, Yufei.

425
00:25:30,331 --> 00:25:31,633
Thank you.

426
00:25:31,633 --> 00:25:34,999
No one has ever said those things to me.

427
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:37,848
Thanks for what? I should be thanking you.

428
00:25:37,848 --> 00:25:40,003
Thanks for rescuing me today.

429
00:25:40,003 --> 00:25:44,296
I hope I can see you at
Binhai University in the coming year.

430
00:25:45,655 --> 00:25:47,760
That's a promise.

431
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,306
Promise.

432
00:25:49,351 --> 00:25:51,014
Bye.

433
00:26:04,343 --> 00:26:06,893
I heard the latest news.

434
00:26:06,893 --> 00:26:08,436
The designing contest.

435
00:26:08,436 --> 00:26:10,310
The great Nanxi has also participated.

436
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,472
I've already heard about it.

437
00:26:15,354 --> 00:26:17,651
Then the game will be interesting.

438
00:26:17,651 --> 00:26:20,640
At that time, I'll do
a comprehensive in-depth report.

439
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,556
Especially with the first-hand
information of the great Nanxi.

440
00:26:23,556 --> 00:26:27,732
This time I want to dominate
the gossip forum of the school papers.

441
00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:36,254
Uhh, let me interview you.

442
00:26:36,254 --> 00:26:39,588
Do you have confidence going
against Nanxi in this competition?

443
00:26:39,588 --> 00:26:43,223
- Nothing to do with you.
 - How can this have nothing to do with me?

444
00:26:43,223 --> 00:26:46,654
That Nanxi and you are a big deal!

445
00:26:46,654 --> 00:26:51,712
That's the architecture school
battle between the top two.

446
00:26:51,712 --> 00:26:55,153
Besides, isn't it also an
internal friendly match between dormmates?

447
00:26:55,178 --> 00:26:58,922
Anyhow, I can't say it has
nothing to do with you, right?

448
00:26:58,922 --> 00:27:00,840
But this time it's not
necessarily predictable.

449
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,888
Yesterday Nanxi was still chasing
the deadline for registration.

450
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:07,621
Now the public display of work
is only less than a month.

451
00:27:07,621 --> 00:27:09,463
I'm really worried for Nanxi.

452
00:27:09,463 --> 00:27:14,310
Do not worry. The great Nanxi
wouldn't sign up if he wasn't confident.

453
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,430
That's true.

454
00:27:17,298 --> 00:27:19,813
Nanxi, Control your dormmates.

455
00:27:19,813 --> 00:27:21,932
Don't let them bother me.

456
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:36,792
Since the independent students' enrolment,
you have always been number one.

457
00:27:36,792 --> 00:27:40,368
This competition, I will definitely win.

458
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:41,989
Goodluck.

459
00:27:42,909 --> 00:27:45,032
A true God.

460
00:27:45,032 --> 00:27:48,317
That boldness, that steadiness.

461
00:27:48,317 --> 00:27:50,497
Are you always that arrogant?

462
00:27:50,497 --> 00:27:52,828
Not seeing anyone else but you?

463
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:55,040
No.

464
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,748
Or, although you are always number one

465
00:27:57,748 --> 00:28:00,348
you don't care about the result at all.

466
00:28:02,005 --> 00:28:05,529
This time, I care.

467
00:28:05,529 --> 00:28:08,235
Then, why are you cheering for me?

468
00:28:08,235 --> 00:28:09,930
Just being polite.

469
00:28:12,693 --> 00:28:14,504
How about we leave now?

470
00:28:14,504 --> 00:28:17,507
Feels like blood will be spilt any time.

471
00:28:17,507 --> 00:28:18,955
Okay.

472
00:28:18,955 --> 00:28:22,152
Hope we can do our best this time.

473
00:28:23,163 --> 00:28:25,576
Your time is running out. Good luck.

474
00:28:25,576 --> 00:28:27,282
I will.

475
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:22,764
Nanxi, how's the search for the wood?

476
00:29:24,592 --> 00:29:27,648
It's not going well?

477
00:29:27,648 --> 00:29:31,543
Would you like to talk to me about it?

478
00:29:58,273 --> 00:30:00,723
First impression?

479
00:30:00,723 --> 00:30:04,736
- That's the theme of this
year's competition?
 - Yes.

480
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:08,556
But what's most beautiful in life
isn't the first impression.

481
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:12,231
It's our understanding
and tolerance together.

482
00:30:15,171 --> 00:30:18,993
But these two pieces of wood
don't seem to be perfect.

483
00:30:18,993 --> 00:30:21,763
Is it intentional?

484
00:30:22,689 --> 00:30:24,460
Yes,

485
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,714
just as imperfect as we are.

486
00:30:26,714 --> 00:30:28,416
Us.

487
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:30,428
Us?

488
00:30:32,069 --> 00:30:34,205
When we are together,

489
00:30:35,122 --> 00:30:37,080
we're perfect.

490
00:30:39,663 --> 00:30:43,109
So you mean,
the most beautiful thing in life

491
00:30:43,109 --> 00:30:45,636
isn't the first impression's rush.

492
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:48,786
But the romance in
getting to know each other?

493
00:30:48,786 --> 00:30:52,782
Two pieces of basswood
shouldn't be together at all.

494
00:30:52,782 --> 00:30:55,426
But they tried their best to be together.

495
00:30:55,426 --> 00:30:57,005
Living the most beautiful life.

496
00:30:57,005 --> 00:30:59,724
Just like us.
Right?

497
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,603
That's right.

498
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:06,904
So the most important thing is to
find the two suitable pieces of wood.

499
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:12,156
I'll go look with you tomorrow, okay?

500
00:31:14,754 --> 00:31:17,273
We will definitely find them.

501
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,146
Miss, you came to the right shop.

502
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:25,116
In all of Binhai, there's nothing
you can't find at our shop.

503
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:28,380
Look at the craftwork of this wood.

504
00:31:34,551 --> 00:31:37,851
As you can see, so much wood.

505
00:31:37,851 --> 00:31:39,188
Look around.

506
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,205
Which one is more suitable for you?

507
00:31:41,205 --> 00:31:44,640
Then we can both suggest our offers.

508
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,043
- All around, good business.
- Sure, just a moment.

509
00:31:47,043 --> 00:31:49,491
What do you think?
Anything you like?

510
00:31:50,673 --> 00:31:52,633
Boss, How about this?

511
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:56,975
We'll think about it back home and
contact you if we need anything.

512
00:31:56,975 --> 00:32:01,112
Well, I've been serving you
for a long time taking you around.

513
00:32:01,112 --> 00:32:02,949
I'm thirsty, losing my voice here!

514
00:32:02,949 --> 00:32:06,410
Very sorry. It's just that
we have to think about it, isn't it?

515
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:08,637
We'll go back and think.
We'll call you if we need anything, okay?

516
00:32:08,637 --> 00:32:09,484
Thank you, thank you.

517
00:32:09,484 --> 00:32:13,192
- I can give a discount! I ca--
- Thank you, thank you.

518
00:32:13,192 --> 00:32:15,317
These kids.

519
00:32:15,817 --> 00:32:21,268
Those more realistic wood that you want,
should be here. Take a look.

520
00:32:21,268 --> 00:32:23,640
Should be able to find it, right?

521
00:32:31,224 --> 00:32:33,526
I'll help you look.

522
00:32:51,716 --> 00:32:53,478
What are you doing?

523
00:32:54,127 --> 00:32:57,187
Let me climb.
Which one do you want?

524
00:32:57,187 --> 00:32:59,331
Be careful.

525
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:02,268
You be careful.

526
00:33:07,255 --> 00:33:08,810
Pass me the knife.

527
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:13,324
Let me help you up there.

528
00:33:15,131 --> 00:33:16,717
Don't climb too high.

529
00:33:16,717 --> 00:33:18,673
Be careful.

530
00:33:26,928 --> 00:33:28,281
Somebody's coming.
What are you doing?

531
00:33:28,281 --> 00:33:30,498
- What are you doing?
- Come down! Quick!

532
00:33:32,609 --> 00:33:34,272
Stop!

533
00:33:44,502 --> 00:33:45,620
- Are you two really students?
- We are really students.

534
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,498
We just came to find the
things for him to make.

535
00:33:51,498 --> 00:33:55,460
The kind of wood to participate in
a competition. Nothing else.

536
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,645
I've watched the surveillance video.
You didn't really do anything.

537
00:33:57,645 --> 00:34:00,371
But the trees here are only for viewing.
Without governmental approval,

538
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,200
it's impossible to use.
Not even cutting, or selling.

539
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,513
Why don't you go somewhere else
to find what you want?

540
00:34:05,513 --> 00:34:07,143
Stop having this idea again, okay?

541
00:34:07,143 --> 00:34:08,230
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

542
00:34:13,835 --> 00:34:16,332
Unbelievable.

543
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:19,931
Where do we go next?

544
00:34:23,141 --> 00:34:25,460
I know who to look for.

545
00:34:36,854 --> 00:34:39,294
In Binhai, there's nowhere that
your Uncle Wang can't look for.

546
00:34:39,294 --> 00:34:41,022
Let's go!

547
00:34:46,493 --> 00:34:50,051
Uncle Wang, what is this place?

548
00:34:50,051 --> 00:34:51,441
Don't underestimate this place.

549
00:34:51,441 --> 00:34:54,288
It's the biggest root carving
market in Binhai.

550
00:34:54,288 --> 00:34:57,439
If you need wood
most of them are here.

551
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,644
Nanxi, do you think this is the place?

552
00:35:02,644 --> 00:35:05,709
Let's see. Look for it slowly.

553
00:35:05,709 --> 00:35:09,789
Since you're here,
just go with your heart.

554
00:35:09,789 --> 00:35:14,259
Here, there's nothing that you can't look
for, only the unimaginable.

555
00:35:14,259 --> 00:35:16,343
Thank you, Uncle Wang.
It's too much trouble for you.

556
00:35:16,343 --> 00:35:17,916
Just a small matter.

557
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:23,884
Since President Ren arranged this, I will
do my best to help you find what you want.

558
00:35:24,524 --> 00:35:25,556
How about this?

559
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:28,456
- Nanxi what do you think?
- This wood is so big!

560
00:35:30,067 --> 00:35:31,920
Still not very satisfied.

561
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,720
Not yet?

562
00:35:46,668 --> 00:35:50,143
What kind of wood is this?

563
00:36:05,607 --> 00:36:07,369
Be careful.

564
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:14,460
This is it.

565
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,752
These two?

566
00:36:17,482 --> 00:36:19,732
These two pieces of rotten wood?

567
00:36:19,732 --> 00:36:22,368
The reason why these
two pieces of wood were abandoned,

568
00:36:22,368 --> 00:36:24,469
it's because they have irregular shapes.

569
00:36:24,469 --> 00:36:27,952
But in fact they came from the same tree.

570
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:29,216
Same tree.

571
00:36:29,216 --> 00:36:30,644
What kind of tree is this?

572
00:36:30,644 --> 00:36:32,900
It's a tree connected by root.

573
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,411
This piece is the south part.

574
00:36:35,411 --> 00:36:36,906
This piece is the east.

575
00:36:36,906 --> 00:36:39,297
All deviated from the main root.

576
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:41,115
Same

577
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:43,078
but different.

578
00:36:46,518 --> 00:36:48,556
But is this in line with our theme?

579
00:36:48,556 --> 00:36:51,248
You can even see that?

580
00:36:51,248 --> 00:36:53,868
This son of President Ren,

581
00:36:53,868 --> 00:36:56,664
is really remarkable.

582
00:36:56,664 --> 00:36:58,060
Uncle Wang, I want to ask.
Is the wood for sale?

583
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,643
Of course. Besides,
these are all rotten wood.

584
00:37:04,643 --> 00:37:06,667
Better than giving it out for free.

585
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:08,878
You just settle it here.
Stay here.

586
00:37:08,878 --> 00:37:09,889
I'll go talk to them.

587
00:37:09,889 --> 00:37:11,470
Okay, thank you Uncle Wang.

588
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,100
You're welcome.

589
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,195
Nanxi.

590
00:37:21,195 --> 00:37:24,888
How long do you think these
two pieces of wood have been together?

591
00:37:24,888 --> 00:37:29,244
About 10 years or so.

592
00:37:29,244 --> 00:37:33,202
Then how long do you think they
were together when they were still trees?

593
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:37,692
About 360 years.

594
00:37:37,692 --> 00:37:40,207
Just 360 years?

595
00:37:40,207 --> 00:37:41,872
But I

596
00:37:41,872 --> 00:37:45,230
want to be with you forever.

597
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,773
I want to be with you forever too.
