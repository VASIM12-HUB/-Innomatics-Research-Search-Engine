Don't be angry

14
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,260
It didn't hurt you purposely

15
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,450
I'll come to you if you're angry

16
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,820

I'll do it myself

44
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,340
It's good if you could record it

45
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,500
Have you zipped the bag shut?

46
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,140
Yes

58
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,020
Now?

59
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,940

62
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,540
My goodness!

00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,020
I wanted to make a simple antiseptic

66
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,940
You stir it with the pipette?

67
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,300
Oh yeah

68
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,660
Miss Li Na did ask us to make a proposal

69
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,740
for the orange juice
advertisement that day

70
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,820
Don't you think Miss Li Na

71
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,060
likes to order trainee?

72
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,540
She wanted us to do the proposals,

73
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,660
but never submits it

74
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,500
Are you listening to me?

I just want to ask you

80
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,620
to submit the proposal
together with me

81
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,220
Are you sick?

82
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,940
You always ahead me

I'll wait for you then

84
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,580
Alright

85
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,380
Take the coffee and do your proposal

86
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,340
Okay

87
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,140
Focus on the internal structure

88
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,660
and jot down the data

89
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,060
Gu Wei Yi, how is my kitten?

90
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:07,780
Pretty good

91
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,700
Did it miss me?

92
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,260
Stop chatting

93
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,460
Don't waste your time on a kitten

94
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,340
How could you raise a cat in the lab?

95
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,060
Ridiculous

Zhou Lei

97
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,060
You're always

98
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,620
affected by the mess

99
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,340
Look at your result

100
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,820
You always get the lowest mark

101
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,740
You should take care of the cat

102
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,340
Why should I?

103
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,180
Because you don't allow
me to raise it in the lab

104
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,700
Your wife is the dorm keeper

105
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,660
She didn't allow it too

106
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,900
Now your family

107
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,940
hurt our family

108
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:43,580
Well...

109
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,080

Fu Pei!

125
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:10,490
Enjoy yourselves

126
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:11,530
One more!

127
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:12,850
Who is that?

128
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,170
Did you see I make the 3 point shot?

129
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:14,970
Yes

130
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:15,450

131
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,050
Charming

132
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,450
Extremely charming

Let's have some food

134
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:19,490
You have studied for a day

135
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,730
Let's have something nice

136
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:22,930
Let me enjoy it for a while

137
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,050
Studied with brain

138
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,490
is more tiring than me

139
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:26,370
We must eat something

140
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:28,210
Let's go

141
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:29,050

144
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:32,850
Okay

145
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,010
Let's continue

146
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,090
What do you want to eat?

147
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:38,530
I just received

148
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,170
the notice from the university

149
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,170
They will have an equipment check

150
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,730
in the labs at 4pm

151
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,890
So, we must finish all the job

152
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:47,890
before 3pm today

153
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,930
I have something

154
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,290
So I can take a leave now

155
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,130

We can bring the kitten
for vaccination in the noon

158
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,290
I have no time for it

159
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,010
You always have no time

160
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,010
You raise it, you should be responsible

161
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:09,850
I have an examination in the noon

162
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,130
I applied leave yesterday

163
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,810
Yes, Xiao Gu applied leave yesterday

164
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:17,810
Senior

165
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,250
Can you bring the kitten
for vaccination in the noon?

166
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,730
I have applied leave for the noon

167
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:22,730
to correct the thesis

168
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,050
I thought the graduates are free

169
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,610
I'm a postgraduate

170
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,770
Don't look at me, I'm a Professor

171
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,050
Professor is the freest among us

172
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:36,930
Professor Jiang

173
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:41,610
I'm full

174
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:42,810
Enjoy your meal

175
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,250
I have looked into all the proposals

176
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:53,890
It was suck!

177
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,010
Only Li Na's proposal is accepted

178
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:58,410
But,

179
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,690
you are the creative director

180
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,850
I hope you share the ideas

181
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,930
and guides to your
members without hiding it

182
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,530
Alright, brief us about it

183
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:09,330
Okay

184
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,490
Focus on the health

185
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,930
We'll set Lin Zhi Cun to
be a software programmer

186
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,370
who has sub-health problems

187
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,210
Moreover, he's a "budget husband",

188
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,050
who is the most popular man so far

189
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,290
He measures

190
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,090
everything with a perfect form

191
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,740
"Like"                                                "Form"

192
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,770
Focus on your experiment

193
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,650
Otherwise,

194
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,770
I'll chase the cat out

195
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,210
I'm serious

196
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,330
in the experiment

197
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:50,370
Xiao Gu

198
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,170
Try another connector

199
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:27,930
"You are passing by or staying here?"

200
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,210
"Crash makes a crush"

201
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:35,050
"My serene heart ripples"

202
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:39,210
"Tomorrow will be bright or rain"

203
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:42,730
"Depends on your tone"

204
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,670
"You hide or encroach"

205
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,040
"Marking Form for Gu Wei Yi"

206
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,450
"Here and faraway"

207
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:53,970
"Always meet accidentally"

208
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:58,810
"See your breath, look at your face"

209
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,530
"Can I sense it?"

210
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,330
"Guess if I could"

211
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,850
"conquer your heart"

212
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:11,490
"Any story line for me?"

213
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:17,170
"My heart is hiding the
puzzle for your answer"

214
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,130
"Are you willing to..."

215
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,090
It's good then

216
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,690
The feeble-minded?

217
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,070
"The lowest energy spectrum"

218
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,120
What are you dreaming?

219
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:48,730
Professor

220
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,410
I have something to discuss with you

221
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:53,930
Okay

222
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:56,050
Say it

223
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:57,690
I want to join too

224
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:58,890
Come on

225
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,370
About relationship

226
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:08,650
Okay, say it

227
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:09,770
We are listening

228
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,290
When I was unconscious in a drunk,

229
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:16,690
I kissed Si Tu Mo

230
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,450
But I forgot it

231
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,890
I wanted to kiss her after I recalled it

232
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:28,810
But she pushed me away

233
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,610
Does it mean she hates me?

234
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,770
But you said

235
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,170
she was jealous because of me

236
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,210
She should be into me

237
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,490
She must hate you

238
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,250
You're trying to harass her

239
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:44,770
Cut the crap!

240
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,930
She should have made a police report

241
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,370
But she didn't

242
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:53,930
I'll go home and ask her

243
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,250
If I were her,

244
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,650
I'll lock the door

245
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,250
and won't listen to you

246
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,090
Xiao Gu

247
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:02,810
Take it easy

248
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,050
Think about it

249
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,650
This is not the first time

250
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,010
we attemp to conquer Si Tu Mo

251
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,170
Before, we couldn't make it

252
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,330
because we didn't use scientific ways

253
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:12,210
So,

254
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:15,050
we must find a better way

255
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,810
from the scientific mind

256
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,050
to conquer her

257
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:20,850
Let's think about

258
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,410
Scientific ways

259
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:32,730
I have an idea

260
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:34,530
I ask you

261
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:35,770
What is science?

262
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,050
Always come with hypothesis,

263
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,610
infer and find out the truth

264
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:41,690
So,

265
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:42,770
we must

266
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,370
find out the truth

267
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:49,650
with 3 kinds of hypotheses
that we have now

268
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,170
Professor Jiang

269
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,370
What are the hypotheses?

270
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,410
Think about it

271
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,050
Like

272
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,010
Hate

273
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,650
Dislike and harmless

274
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,210
Gu Wei Yi analyzed it thoroughly

275
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,130
First

276
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:08,050
Of course

277
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,290
is "Like"

278
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:10,610
Alright?

279
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,450
The inference is so simple

280
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,370
No matter what Gu Wei Yi does,

281
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:15,730
it has only one outcome

282
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,410
Successful

283
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,090
What about the second hypothesis?

284
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,450
Second

285
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,130
Hate

286
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,250
This is the most likely situation

287
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,850
which I can tell

288
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,730
from the way Si Tu Mo ignored Gu Wei Yi

289
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,730
If you want to make it clear,

290
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,530
it has a drawback there

291
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,570
Like what Zhou Lei said

292
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,570
Si Tu Mo might hide from you and

293
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:41,730
it will cause two of you

294
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,210
unable to communicate

295
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,290
In short,

296
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,810
Gu Wei Yi must find a place where

297
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,690
Si Tu Mo can't run away
to confess to her

298
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,050
Moreover, the place

299
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,010
must be romantic

300
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,650
How we could get it?

301
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,770
You should think about it

302
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:04,890
I have no idea

303
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:07,690
It's about time

304
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,690
Quickly complete the form

305
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,010
and leave the lab

306
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,890
The staff will come here for a check

307
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:14,410
Professor Jiang

308
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,530
Don't forget to bring
the kitten for vaccination

309
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:49,650
Why are you here?

310
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,090
I'll bring you to somewhere

311
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,010
Where?

312
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,330
Come with me and you'll know it

313
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:56,610
Please hold it

314
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:00,930
Hello, Miss Li Na

315
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:14,290
Okay

316
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:21,530
I got it

317
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:24,490
Okay

318
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:28,890
Where do you want to go with me?

319
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:32,290
Let's have some food

320
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,730
I have eaten during the
tea break and still full

321
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:35,890
Let's eat again

322
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:37,970
I don't want to eat

323
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:41,850
Let's go

324
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,730
Where are we going?

325
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:55,970
You'll know it

326
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,370
Are you hungry?

327
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:00,730
Let's have some food

328
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,290
I'm not hungry

329
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:04,650
Mew...

330
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:07,410
Mew...

331
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,250
How are you?

332
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:13,970
What are you doing?

333
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:15,370
Carry the cat

334
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,330
Aren't you having an allergy to cats?

335
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,610
I can overcome it

336
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,290
Overcome, huh?

337
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,210
Let's go

338
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:31,610
Bye!

339
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:43,850
Professor Jiang

340
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,450
In the electronic correlation
of topology of flat belt,

341
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,650
the interaction of fermion and boson,

342
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,890
numerical studies of
quantum lattice systems,

343
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,650
an Abel type of

344
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:54,970
Quantum Hall effect was found

345
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:56,890
as well as non-Abelian Quantum Hall

346
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:58,730
What?

347
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:00,650
The kitten scratches me

348
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:01,370
Bye

349
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:05,290
That's right

350
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:06,690
Exactly

351
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:09,770
Okay

352
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:12,730
Are you busy?

353
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:15,210
No

354
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,610
Let's go

355
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,050
to the place next time

356
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:19,610
Almost there

357
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:20,970
Let's go

358
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:33,330
Gosh! My honey

359
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:35,690
Pork liver again

360
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:37,970
She used to cook pork liver everyday

361
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,210
Mew...

362
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:44,290
Mew...

363
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:45,970
This is good for your health

364
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,090
Eat some meat

365
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,610
after the vaccination

366
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:51,530
Hurry up!

367
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,330
Eat the meat

368
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,850
so that you'll become a big boy

369
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:58,650
Eat the meat

370
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,090
Don't eat my eggs

371
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:04,970
Don't eat the eggs

372
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:07,050
Eat the liver

373
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,450
This is good for your health

374
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:10,330
Come on

375
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,170
Eat more

376
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,090
Eat some meat after the vaccination

377
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,810
Where do you want to bring me to?

378
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:25,330
Here it is

379
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,410
Playground?

380
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,130
To have fun here?

381
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,210
I wait for you at the entrance

382
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:38,810
Must find a place where

383
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,930
Si Tu Mo can't run away
to confess to her

384
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:48,690
You only play this in the playground?

385
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:50,090
I want to ride the roller-coaster

386
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:51,690
Too noisy

387
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,330
Why did you come then?

388
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:55,650
Just want to make you relaxed

389
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,170
To me, the most relaxing way

390
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,850
is lying on the bed after work

391
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:08,370
I have something to tell you

392
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:13,490
What's that?

393
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:15,810
This morning...

394
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:22,650
Say it

395
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:24,330
I want to tell you...

396
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,290
What do you want to tell me?

397
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,170
Hit him!

398
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:42,650
Say what?

399
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:44,850
Say it

What do you want to say?

402
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,050
One more time

403
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:23,290
No way

Say it now

407

412
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,690
after the vaccination

413
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,530
I couldn't get Zhou Lei

414
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,130
I'll be right there

415
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,090
I need to rush to the pet clinic

416
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:07,730
Why?

417
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:28,170
Professor

418
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:29,650
What are you doing?

419
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:32,810
I used to smoke before

420
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:34,490
Even stopped smoking,
but I can't get out of it

421
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,530
I want to smoke when I'm anxious

422

423
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:42,570
How is our baby?

424
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:43,850
It's okay

425
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:45,490
It's in a fever and sleepy

426
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:46,610
Some kittens

427
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,490

428
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:49,530
No problem

429

Be gentle, let it rest

432
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,650
We must bring it home

433
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:04,410
No

434
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:05,850
You guys go home first

435
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,250
I'll bring it home later

436
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:10,970
It stays in our house all this while

437
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:12,970
From today onwards,

438
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,010
I'll bring it home

439
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,050
I'll take care of it

440
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:17,490
But...

441
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,250
It's alright

442
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,410
Professor, this is our kitten

443
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:40,730
I...

444
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:42,730
I'll give it to you

445
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:44,730
But I want to hug it for a while

446
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:50,170
Be gentle

447
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,170
Be gentle, it just got a vaccination

448
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:56,330
Be gentle

449
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:08,130

When do you want to bath?

459
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:46,570
I want to clean the sewage

460
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,050
I'll go first

461
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:25,570

Liuzhou River Snails Rice Noodle?

468
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:02,930
Yes

469
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,330
Wait for a moment

470
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,090
Why do you cook the Snails Rice Noodle?

471
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,570
You didn't take your dinner last night

472
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,370
No one will eat this

473
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:25,730
in the morning

474
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,490

476
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:33,650
Go ahead, I'll eat it

477
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:34,450
I'll wait there

478
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:36,530
Wait a minute

479
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:55,210
Only one? Don't you want to eat?

480
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:58,890
I have eaten outside

481
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:01,810
Taste it

482
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:06,970

go back to your room

Hey
