My girl friend is an Alien

3
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,760
Recenly, the Pan-STARRS 1 telescope in Hawaii

4
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,840
spotted an unknown spacecraft

5
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,760
when looking for near-earth objects for NASA.

6
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,080
It has been substantiated that

7
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,600
this unique object zooming through our solar system

8
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,200
is the first interstellar asteriod.

9
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:01,880
Mr. Fang,

10
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,290
Maybe there will be a heavy rain tonight

11
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,450
You should come back as soon as possible.

12
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,160
Got it.

13
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,640
Scientists suspected that

14
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,440
this unidentified flying object may be coming from

15
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,440
an extrasolar double star system.

16
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,600
According to the research done by Evan Jackson

17
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,640
and other planetary scientists of the University of Toronto...

18
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,880
Earthling...

19
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,320
This hormone smells so great.

20
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,920
Be mindful with your hands.

21
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,640
Mr. Fang,

22
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,800
I am here to exam you.

23
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,920
Since your car accident from a week ago,

24
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,640
we have done all the exams we can think of.

25
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,160
We couldn't find anything wrong with you.

26
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,960
Didn't you mention a shadow found in chest area?

27
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,400
Were you able to confirm?

28
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,800
Nothing abnormal was found for now.

29
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,840
We suspect that it is hematocele.

30
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,040
Mr. Fang,

31
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,160
Do you remember what happened?

32
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,320
Besides passing out due to the crash,

33
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,840
Nothing.

34
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,280
Nothing at all?

35
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,000
Was it raining?

36
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,160
Yes,

37
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,200
It was raining.

38
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,760
I see.

39
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,640
You can leave now.

40
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,720
If anything happens I will let you know.

41
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,280
Okay then. Take a rest, Mr. Fang.

43
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,400
Hello, Uncle Wang Jianguo.

44
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,840
I got lost on earth.

45
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,360
Now I am suppressed by gravity,

46
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
There is no way for me to go into the space.

47
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,280
Is this the northern hemisphere?

48
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,160
Help!

49
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,080
Well, the Earthlings are not hospitable at all.

50
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,200
What the heck?

51
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,600
Don't drop me. Don't drop me, Xiaoqi.

52
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,040
It's me,

53
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,150
your private secretary Cubrile.

54
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,040
Xiaobu,

55
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,160
what happened to you?

56
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,160
It was  your rescue of the male Earthling,

57
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,200
that I fell into the river with you.

58
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,280
Now my central processing unit was eaten by this tortoise.

59
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,000
I will have to communicate with you through this tortoise.

60
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,720
The transmitted sound was through low frequency sound wave.

61
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,360
Only you can hear me.

62
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,680
You have been laying in the river for seven solar days.

63
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,280
The spacecraft has gone on the homeward voyage.

64
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,520
We are so falling behind.

65
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,480
It is okay.

66
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,920
I will connect with the headquarter through my annunciator.

67
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,360
Where is my annunciator?

68
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,480
I am screwed.

69
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,200
I lost my annunciator.

70
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,920
I might have lost it on

71
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,840
the man I saved.

72
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,240
Do you remember

73
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,720
The face of the man you saved?

74
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,120
Not so much about the face.

75
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,880
But I do remember his

76
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,440
body shape.

77
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,320
Dear Master,

78
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,680
it is a sunny day today.

79
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,760
The temperature is about 30â„ƒ,

80
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,200
with humidity of 40%.

81
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,400
Cold air or rainfall

82
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,920
are not expected for the week.

83
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:32,760
Dressing index...

84
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,280
Mr. Fang,

85
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,240
Grade Four.

86
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,680
we got real trouble in the company.

87
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,680
Speak.

88
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,680
You ex-girl friends have rallied

89
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,440
in front of the company for payback.

90
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,120
Ex-girl friend?

91
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,760
Ex-girl friends.

92
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,490
I have made enquiries of several people.

93
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,800
This is a well-organized event

94
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,000
forcing you into marriage.

95
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,520
The girl friends you have abandoned...

96
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:10,920
I meant...

97
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,960
broke up peacefully...

98
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,040
have called many media

99
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,440
to host a live press conference in our company.

100
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,120
In short,

101
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,640
please do not come to the company today.

102
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,800
You just had a car accident.

103
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,720
I will ask for enhanced security.

104
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,720
I will be right there.

105
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,440
Mr. Fang, Mr. Fang.

106
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,760
We have a very enthusiastic scene here today.

107
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,360
I bet the brides are equally excited.

108
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,920
For those who are still hanging there in front of the live cam,

109
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,840
our main cast today

110
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,480
Fang leng,the eldest son of the billionaire Fang Shida,

111
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,000
has finally arrived.

112
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,440
Photographer

113
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,280
hurry, turn your lens towards Mr. Fang.

114
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:36,800
Mr. Fang,

115
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,240
Mr. Fang,

116
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,840
what do you think of today's forcing marriage event?

117
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,920
Thanks for all the attention from the media.

118
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,160
It is a shame to cash on love

119
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,720
in the world.

120
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,520
Afterall,  love is a matter of two people.

121
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,760
Bring me the brides.

122
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,280
Mr. Fang,

123
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:14,720
Relax.

124
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,640
I will make them disassociate from me.

125
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:20,960
Mr. Fang,

126
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,440
Ever since we had dinner together,

127
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,520
you act as if you do not remember me.

128
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,320
Sunny,

129
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,280
No time today.

130
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,200
From now on,

131
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,320
you only need to listen to what we have to say to you.

132
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,440
Sunny,

133
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,600
your real name is Sun Yanli.

134
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,640
a domestic emerging fashion model.

135
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,120
You met with Mr. Fang on a Charity Gala last year.

136
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,040
How did you gather all these information?

137
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,840
Our F Group owns

138
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,200
top-notch domestic network companies.

139
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,720
Everything we want to know,

140
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,280
we do know.

141
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,280
This flight ticket

142
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,160
will send you directly to Paris

143
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,080
for a New Product Lauch shooting for the VOGUE Magazine.

144
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,520
Whether or not you can become a top model globally

145
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,000
depends on whether or not you seize on this opportunity.

146
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,120
You should know what I meant.

147
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,760
I understand.

148
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,760
Thank you very much, Mr. Fang.

149
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,880
Sorry for all the trouble.

150
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,560
Next.

151
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,200
See what that jackass junior

152
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,920
has done to our company.

153
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,840
May I ask the brides

154
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,920
your opinions on Mr. Fang being such a womanizer?

155
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,040
Do you have anything more to disclose?

156
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,520
Who said that Mr. Fang is a womanizer?

157
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,640
Mr. Fang was right.

158
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,480
Love is a matter of two people only.

159
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,840
It is not  proper to cash it

160
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,120
I hope the media

161
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,800
can respect our personal privacy.

162
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,680
What happened?

163
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,680
I don't know... what the heck?

164
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,480
Let's go. Thank you everyone.

165
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,840
Don't leave.

166
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,480
Any brides left?

167
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,080
That's all.

168
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:17,760
Mr. Fang,

169
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,440
this is the data we have compiled.

170
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,840
Your female-targeting amnesia

171
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,760
synchronizes with thunderstorm almost exactly.

172
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,400
Mr. Fang,

173
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,160
should we look for new girl friends for you?

174
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,600
No need.

175
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,840
Contact Dr. Zhang for me.

176
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:33,800
Got it.

177
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,480
Oh Well

178
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,440
Do you have the findings

179
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,240
for the car accident?

180
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,200
You were the only one on the scene,

181
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,040
so there was no collateral damage.

182
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:43,880
However,

183
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,880
there is one thing for you to have a look.

184
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,440
When you were in the coma,

185
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,480
you were holding this blue stone in your hand.

186
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,720
I thought it must be important to you,

187
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,440
so I collected it for you.

188
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,840
Do you have any impressions with it?

189
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,400
It is not mine.

190
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,680
Bring it to the Research Department

191
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,840
and ask them to find out the origin of this stone.

192
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:08,920
Got it.

193
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,280
Xiaoqi,

194
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,680
your mistake was that you couldn't resist

195
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,320
the temptation of the six packs of the male earthlings.

196
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,400
You left the spaceship recklessly to save him

197
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,080
knowing that lust is a deadly sin.

198
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,360
You made me sin with you.

199
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,480
Alright.

200
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,160
I am trying to fix it here.

201
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,040
You should think carefully.

202
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,000
And seriously.

203
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,400
The details, right, the details.

204
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,320
You should draw everything

205
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,120
you could remember about the earthling.

206
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,760
Draw it out meticulously.

207
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,800
It is done.

208
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,680
How is it?

209
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,560
Hold me up?

210
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,160
What do you mean?

211
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,440
Hold me up so that I can take a look.

212
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,720
I am a tortoise now.

213
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,240
Oh right.

214
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,280
I forgot.

215
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,720
See.

216
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,120
How is it?

217
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,720
How are you possibly gonna find him

218
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,560
with a drawing like this?

219
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,760
I didn't take a good look at his face.

220
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,280
Isn't it just about finding a man?

221
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,000
There is a lack of everything here on earth

222
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,800
except for men with two legs.

223
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,000
Let's go.

224
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,840
According to my scan of the earthlings,

225
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,280
there is one place we should go first.

226
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,720
Wow this set of clothes is really pretty.

227
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,200
Do I look like an earthling?

228
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,360
According to the ''Earth Survival Handbook''

229
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,040
we should resist inferior culture of the earth

230
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,040
corroding us Cape Townian.

231
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,120
Not only didn't you reject them,

232
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,080
you are wearing them.

233
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,720
I am only pretending to be an earling,

234
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,360
so that I can find my annunciator.

235
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,520
I have decided,

236
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,640
I am gonna wear this set.

237
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,400
No.

238
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,640
According to the handbook, on the earth

239
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,200
you should only wear this dress when getting married.

240
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,840
What is getting married?

241
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,280
A synonym for copulation.

242
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,360
Earthlings are still using primary way to breed.

243
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,320
It is unlike us.

244
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,640
We can simply login on Gene-sharing System.

245
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,000
I am fine with getting married with someone

246
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,440
if I can go out wearing such a pretty dress.

247
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,920
I am gonna wear this dress.

248
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,000
No you cannot. You cannot wear this.

249
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,440
Am I pretty? Am I pretty?

250
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,080
A thief!

251
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,280
Catch the thief.

252
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,680
Who is the thief?

253
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,760
It is you.

254
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,560
The earth has not yet evolved to a sharing society.

255
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,720
The trade of goods is through exchange of money.

256
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,760
It is an emergency.

257
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,320
Teleport out.

258
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,080
I...

259
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,120
You, the thief, stop right there.

260
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,440
Freeze.

261
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,600
Freeze.

262
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,680
Stop running.

263
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,000
The cars...

264
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,040
are gonna

265
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,160
explode.

266
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,520
Freeze.

267
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,280
Stop running.

268
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,720
Catch her. She is a thief.

269
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,400
See you.

270
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,160
Stop running.

271
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,520
Stop right there.

272
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,360
Generally speaking,

273
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,320
family of origin can affect a person's entire life,

274
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,640
especially  gender relations.

275
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,320
Your situation is more complex.

276
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,840
You mother died in a rainstorm.

277
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,160
This event

278
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,080
affects you deeply

279
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,400
on a subconscious level.

280
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,280
To protect yourself,

281
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,120
you forget the females you have met with recently

282
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,200
every time you experience a rainstorm.

283
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,280
Call it female-targeting amnesia or

284
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,160
neurosis self preservation.

285
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,120
After all,

286
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,370
it was because that you cannot overcome the psychological trauma.

287
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,640
Besides amnesia,

288
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,920
am I gonna hallucinate?

289
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,440
Freeze time

290
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,680
For example...

291
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,120
Clinically, we have never seen

292
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,840
anything like that.

293
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,480
Would it be possible that

294
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,560
you are experiencing too much pressure from work?

295
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,520
Thanks to you,

296
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,040
I had to dealt with dozens of brides today.

297
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,560
I am not the one to blame here.

298
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,360
Back when we were in school,

299
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,760
you purposefully hid your condition.

300
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,200
All these years I have never regretted for hidding it.

301
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,440
Sure. Sure.

302
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,200
Mr. Fang is a master strategic planner.

303
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,880
You have endured great hardship

304
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,920
and became the chief executive of the F Group

305
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,760
under the nose of your stepmother's.

306
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,760
However,

307
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,440
the pressing matter of the moment is that

308
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,000
you need to fix your problem.

309
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,240
You must not let them get it to you.

310
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,680
Good for you know.

311
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,800
Prescribe me some meds.

312
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,200
Stop the shenanigans.

313
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,640
Shop Opening Party.

314
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,880
Take you to the tropical desert.

315
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,400
Six-pack abs.

316
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,000
Xiaoqi,

317
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,200
didn't we make a deal that we are gonna find that earthling?

318
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,960
I am right here looking.

319
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,320
Hey.

320
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,680
Xiaoqi, wake up.

321
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,200
Do you smell anything?

322
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,520
Smell of what?

323
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,880
Hormone.

324
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:45,800
Back then, that man

325
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,600
lured me off the spaceship to save him

326
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,920
by using this smell.

327
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,040
Did you know?

328
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,000
male hormone.

329
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,720
Male hormone is hallucinogenic drug with Level 10 alert

330
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,240
on our Planet Cape Town.

331
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,200
It is a banned substance, Xiaoqi.

332
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,000
I had no choice.

333
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,480
Not you.

334
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,040
Not you neither.

335
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,000
None of you are the man I was looking for.

336
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,480
Here.

337
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,680
Drink this cup.

338
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,960
And we will be him.

339
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,760
Really?

340
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,520
Drink this cup.

341
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,080
And we will be him.

342
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,640
Cheers.

343
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,440
Xiaoqi.

344
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,360
Xiaoqi,

345
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,440
''Earth Survival Handbook'' has stressed that

346
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,760
alcohol is hallucinogenic drug.

347
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,680
Stay away from it.

348
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,760
What should I do now?

349
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,080
I've already drunk it.

350
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I am not only a bit dizzy,

351
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,760
but also a bit excited.

352
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,400
You are bringing a little tortoise with you.

353
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,160
How adorable.

354
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,720
Let us take a look.

355
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,680
Xiaobu.

356
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,560
Who did this?

357
00:20:59,560 --> 00:20:59,960
Who?

358
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,400
Who?

359
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,160
You... you pay for it.

360
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,760
You... you all...

361
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,400
Don't go.

362
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,640
Xiaobu,

363
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,600
is he the one I have saved?

364
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,120
I still remember...

365
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,040
A princess.

366
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,960
# I still remember that year #

367
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,600
# seeing you holding his hand. #

368
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,280
# But I forgot to identify #

369
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,120
# as a bystander.#

370
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,760
# Being alone and craving for the moment #

371
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,680
# to be hit by the memories. #

372
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,920
# My soul is turning to steel #

373
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,120
# longing for the disappearing #

374
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,520
# disappearing... #

375
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,120
Bro,

376
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,600
I... I am drawing pictures in the art room.

377
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,040
My main task today is to

378
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,560
combine the styles of

379
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,000
impressionism and brutalism.

380
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,280
I feel like  hearing music.

381
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,000
Nope.

382
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,280
I am just having some light music for inspiration.

383
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,040
Bro, no need to come to see me.

384
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,360
I am gonna go to bed soon.

385
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,200
See you tomorrow, bro.

386
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,800
Stop knocking. I am coming out.

387
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,480
Han... Bro Han...

388
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,120
Sorry about that, Miss.

389
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,040
Can you please pay the bill first?

390
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,520
The total is

391
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,720
48,965 RMB.

392
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,600
Please pay the bill.

393
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,680
What does it mean?

394
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,400
You ordered two bottles of red wine, worth 15,000 RMB each.

395
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:04,960
And there is more.

396
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,120
The male models I have hired, you picked them all.

397
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,960
Totaling 48,965 RMB.

398
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,040
Can you please pick up the check?

399
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,320
I don't have any money.

400
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,200
Whose daughter is this?

401
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,480
Jack Ma has one son that I can recall of.

402
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,120
and Sephirex Wang doesn't have any sisters neither.

403
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,400
An illegitimate child?

404
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,120
Whatever. None of my business.

405
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,840
She spends money like water.

406
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,440
She must come  from a rich family.

407
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,720
Miss.

408
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,960
You are awake.

409
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,960
I have prepared breakfast for you.

410
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,680
You must be hungry.

411
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,200
Who are you?

412
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,840
Where is it?

413
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,920
I am the boss lady of this place.

414
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,400
You can call me Ms. Chai.

415
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,480
Don't you remember?

416
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,400
Last night

417
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,000
you were partying with us.

418
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,280
You had a great time.

419
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,560
It got too late.

420
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,350
I was afraid it would be dangerous for you to go out alone

421
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,520
so I took you in.

422
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,080
Thank you,

423
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,680
Earthling.

424
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:21,800
Earthling?

425
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,880
Didn't expect you to be a funny gal.

426
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,360
Miss,

427
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,240
you are probably a Rich White Beauty, right?

428
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,960
What is a Rich White Beauty?

429
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,480
Don't be so modest.

430
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,480
You are dressed up like a little princess.

431
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,080
You must be coming from a wealthy family.

432
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,720
I don't have parents.

433
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,440
Ah?

434
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,160
So you are an orphan...

435
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,440
I am not an orphan.

436
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,440
The children on our planet

437
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,440
are bred through gene pool.

438
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,240
We have been long evolved away from the

439
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,720
low-level sexual reproduction method of the earth.

440
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,400
Is this girl out of her mind?

441
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,400
I would be damned.

442
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,560
That's not important.

443
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,160
Just tell me,

444
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,280
what is your name,

445
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,320
and where is your home.

446
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,360
My name is Gillis Cal Qiuso Cara Cara Number Seven.

447
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,640
Are you kidding me?!

448
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,120
Is it because the name a bit long?

449
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,640
I go by Xiaoqi.

450
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,720
Thank you Earthling.

451
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,480
I have to go now. I have something important to do.

452
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,040
Stop right there.

453
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,280
You spent money, do you understand?

454
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,000
Ah?

455
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,920
You spent money here in my shop last night.

456
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,840
You pick a bunch of male models.

457
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,760
Did you forget?

458
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,720
You touched them all.

459
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,080
Here is the tab

460
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,400
plus accommodation,

461
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,680
Water, electricity, and cleaning...

462
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,400
200,000 RMB minimum.

463
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,600
I will give you 20% off.

464
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,520
Let's say 120,000 RMB.

465
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,320
Pay it now.

466
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,040
I don't have money.

467
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:49,840
What?

468
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,520
You don't have any money?

469
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,920
Who are you kidding?!

470
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,240
You are dressed like a million dollars,

471
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:54,960
wearing such expensive watch.

472
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,870
And you claim you have no money?

473
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,520
You like this watch?

474
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,040
Here you are.

475
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,640
This watch

476
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,080
is not enough of payment.

477
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:09,800
Go on.

478
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,720
Oh my goodness.

479
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,400
Why am I falling on evil days?

480
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,320
I hosted such a big party.

481
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,560
Who was it for?

482
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,480
Was it for myself?

483
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,440
I was for every one.

484
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,840
Yet you played with the models, had a great time,

485
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,120
drank the wine,

486
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,920
and I paid my vendors,

487
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,120
you bill on me.

488
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,920
Why? Who was it for?

489
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,760
I don't wanna live anymore.

490
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,080
According to the handbook,

491
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,160
the tears of earthlings represent sadness.

492
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,080
Ms. Chai,

493
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,480
Ms. Chai, do not cry, no more.

494
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,080
You wanna me to pay the bill, right?

495
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,280
I will do anything for you

496
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:55,920
if you stop crying.

497
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,760
I promise.

498
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,800
Okay.

499
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,400
Done.

500
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,080
How is it?

501
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,680
Have you memorized the Code of Conduct of the deliveryman?

502
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,360
Don't worry.

503
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,680
I have great memory.

504
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,800
In your words,

505
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,760
a photographic memory.

506
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,120
Your confused

507
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,160
little brain.

508
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,760
You cannot even remember your name.

509
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Of course I can.

510
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,440
My name is Gillis Cal Qiuso Cara Cara Number Seven.

511
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,320
Stop, stop.

512
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,720
I beg you, from now on

513
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,440
please do not introduce yourself like that.

514
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,080
People would think you are a psycho.

515
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,560
How about this.

516
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,800
What are the odds that we ran into each other.

517
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,760
You can take my surname.

518
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,960
My surname is Chai.

519
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,320
So you will be Chai Xiaoqi.

520
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,120
Chai Xiaoqi.

521
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,640
Chai Xiaoqi.

522
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,840
A beautiful name.

523
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,960
Though we have a bond,

524
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,360
business is business.

525
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,320
Don't worry.

526
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,560
as long as I have a bite-size food,

527
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,960
you will not be the one to starve.

528
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,520
There are good people on the earth.

529
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,720
SugarBomb rejected.

530
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,000
Get to work.

531
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,040
See you later.

532
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,880
Mr. Fang.

533
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,240
Xiaolie has agreed to isolate himself for creation.

534
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,520
Are we gonna interrupt him

535
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,360
barging into his studio?

536
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,400
Exhibition is about to be open to the public.

537
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,080
We cannot indulge his procrastination any longer.

538
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,040
Have you sent help to lock him up?

539
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,640
Of course.

540
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,200
I can promise not even a fly can come out of that place.

541
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,200
Cars.

542
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,440
Mr. Han,

543
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,520
did you see a person standing right there?

544
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,640
Nope.

545
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,120
You cannot come in now.

546
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,120
That is unacceptable.

547
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,080
My boss lady has requested

548
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,160
that we must  deliver personally to the client.

549
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,280
And I cannot leave without a five-star rating.

550
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,360
I said no.

551
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,520
What's all the fuss about?

552
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,400
My boss lady...

553
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,360
The prince.

554
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,720
Are you seriously questioning the deliveryman?

555
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,120
Am I a prisoner?

556
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,240
I am gonna complain to Mr. Fang

557
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,680
that you guys abuse artist.

558
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,400
See,

559
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,600
you are bullying a little girl.

560
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,440
Come in quick.

561
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,600
Let me see if they had hurt you.

562
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,320
You look even better in the daylight

563
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,320
compared to moonlight.

564
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,280
Moonlight?

565
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,120
You saw my show last night?

566
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,640
Yes.

567
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,240
It was rare chance that I got on stage.

568
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,160
It is fate brought us together.

569
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:14,640
Eh!

570
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,360
My name is Fang Lie.

571
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,200
My name is Gillis Cal...

572
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,840
My name is Xiaoqi.

573
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,080
We are friends now.

574
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,080
Your business is my business.

575
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,520
And my business is your business.

576
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,200
So take off your clothes.

577
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:29,960
Ah?

578
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,040
Take... take my clothes off?

579
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,400
As you can see,

580
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,880
I am held here against my will.

581
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,400
And you are the only one who can help me to escape.

582
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,840
Escape?

583
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:42,840
That is...

584
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,240
let me change into your clothes

585
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,880
and get out.

586
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,600
But why are they holding you?

587
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,960
Are you a villain?

588
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,680
Of course not. I am not a villain.

589
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,760
An unscrupulous businessman held me here to paint paintings.

590
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,320
He thought artwork is no different from water from faucet.

591
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,120
You can just turn it on, and artwork flows out.

592
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,200
Art is an explosion of emotion,

593
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,960
a thrill of inspiration.

594
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,200
It is above this world.

595
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,280
How come you are so good-looking even when you are reasoning?

596
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:13,920
Let it out.

597
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,400
How can I help you?

598
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,120
It is really simple. I will wear your clothes and walk out the door.

599
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:18,800
And you will

600
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,680
pretend to be me and stay here.

601
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,880
Don't worry.

602
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,080
That businessman will only be hard on me.

603
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,880
You will not be implicated.

604
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:28,920
Sounds good.

605
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,120
Mr. Fang,

606
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,360
the exhibition starts next month.

607
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,840
you can take a vacation

608
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,880
once you have prepared all the artworks.

609
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,680
Have I seen you before?

610
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,440
Don't get close to me.

611
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,040
I don't know any bad guys like you.

612
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,200
Keeping an artist in captivity illegally.

613
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,680
Where is Fang Lie?

614
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,840
I am not gonna say a word.

615
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,280
Stay away from me.

616
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,560
Stay away from me. If you come any closer,

617
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,760
I am gonna scare you to death using my power.

618
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,360
This is strange... why isn't anything happening?

619
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,040
Don't do anything stupid.

620
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,160
I am not gonna make it difficult for you.

621
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,460
All you need to do is telling me where did Fang Lie go?

622
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,840
Mr. Fang,

623
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,680
what happened?

624
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,280
Who is this?

625
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,440
Mr. Fang, be careful.

626
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,280
No need to chase her.

627
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,520
She can run, but she cannot hide.

628
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,520
Find her,

629
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,440
and you will be able to find Fang Lie.

630
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,520
Ms. Chai.

631
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,160
Ms. Chai,

632
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:02,800
I am sorry.

633
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,840
I lost my work clothes.

634
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,320
How did it get back?

635
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,240
A handsome boy just dropped it off.

636
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,679
He was here.

637
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,879
He really came back for me.

638
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,120
Oh right,

639
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,480
he left you a business card here for you.

640
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,159
He said tonight,

641
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:17,079
he will wait for you in the restaurant on the top floor.

642
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,879
Xiaoqi, I mean...

643
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,040
this is just your first day,

644
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,360
how come you are hooking up with client ?

645
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,320
I...

646
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,679
I am...

647
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,359
I mean it as a compliment.

648
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,520
I am in need of staff like you

649
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,760
who can quickly become friends with clients.

650
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,440
Do you understand?

651
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,480
Ms. Chai, how many deliveries are still out?

652
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,120
I will try to finish them early so that I can take off.

653
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,399
You can still make delivery?

654
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,280
Of course.

655
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,280
I'm full of strength now.

656
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:44,959
Xiaoqi,

657
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,680
you are a man in short supply.

658
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,839
I will go upstairs.

659
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,040
Ms. Chai, I am back.

660
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,120
Ms. Chai?

661
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,840
Ms. Chai?

662
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,080
Stop yelling.

663
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,240
I booked the whole floor.

664
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,160
I am the only one you need to serve.

665
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,720
Chai Xiaoqi, Chai Xiaoqi.

666
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,080
Our biggest client has personally requested for you to stay

667
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,800
How can you say no?

668
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,000
Get back in.

669
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,960
But Ms. Chai,

670
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,880
haven't I clocked out already?

671
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,440
What do you mean?

672
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,920
You don't want to work overtime?

673
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,200
How can you be so selfish?

674
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,680
Can you please think for others?

675
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,600
Can you think for me?

676
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,960
Can you think for this shop?

677
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,560
Do you really have to see that...

678
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,040
Overtime.

679
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,200
Sure I can do overtime.

680
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,680
I can.

681
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,520
I am okay with overtime.

682
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,240
Overtime makes me happy.

683
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,600
Overtime is fulfilling.

684
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,360
I love overtime.

685
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,440
Yeah.

686
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,440
Yeah.

687
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,440
Dear customer,

688
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,280
all the dishes are on the menu.

689
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,240
Please take a look.

690
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:01,880
No need.

691
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,640
Bring me everything

692
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,120
you delivered to the hotel today.

693
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,400
Kitchen crew?

694
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,880
They are dismissed.

695
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:11,920
How about this.

696
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,880
You make it yourself.

697
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,640
You can make one for yourself as well.

698
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,720
Once we are fed,

699
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,000
bring me to Fang Lie.

700
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,080
The one you aid to escape today.

701
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,160
I am really sorry.

702
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,040
Our restaurant doesn't provide outsourcing service.

703
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,480
In fact,

704
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,640
I can only make deliveries.

705
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,520
I cannot cook.

706
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,640
If you have a problem with that,

707
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,920
you can go and find another restaurant.

708
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,040
Boss lady.

709
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,040
I will make it.

710
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,120
Cooking is a piece of cake.

711
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,080
wait here.

712
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,520
I will make you a meal.

713
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,400
Making meal is fulfilling.

714
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,360
An unscrupulous businessman

715
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,720
just like a dead rock on Jinkela

716
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,160
as hard and as stinky.

717
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,960
Wait there, I will be right back.

718
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,040
What is this thing?

719
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,160
The things on earth are so strange.

720
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:06,920
Xiaobu, Xiaobu,

721
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,520
look it up quick, look it up for me.

722
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,400
Xiaobu,

723
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,960
I dropped a little wine onto you

724
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,960
and you cannot speak anymore?

725
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,440
Fine, I will figure it out myself.

726
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,720
And then add this.

727
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,360
Add...

728
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,440
What is happening?

729
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,240
What are you doing?

730
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,560
I am cooking.

731
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,720
Bring me a fire extinguisher.

732
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,040
What does a fire extinguisher look like?

733
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,160
Are you a pig?

734
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:36,760
I...

735
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,760
So you are the person I was trying to find.

736
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,160
What are you saying?

737
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,240
Stay there.

738
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:25,760
Please.

739
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,160
Your hormones is too aggressive .

740
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,040
I feels like freezing.

741
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:29,360
Can you speak human language?
