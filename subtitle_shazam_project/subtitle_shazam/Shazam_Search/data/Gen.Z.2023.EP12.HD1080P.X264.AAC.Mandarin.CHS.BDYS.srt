1
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,983
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,711 --> 00:01:38,202
(Episode 12)

3
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:42,340
Take everything in moderation.

4
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,739
This is my reward for you.

5
00:01:44,948 --> 00:01:45,747
-Here.
-Alright.

6
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:46,900
If so,

7
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,099
I'll take the entire pot.

8
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,539
I don't want to share it with you.

9
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:55,262
Just pour a little for me.

10
00:01:55,419 --> 00:01:56,580
-Come on.
-Take everything in moderation.

11
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,620
You said so yourself.

12
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,188
-Just a little more.
-Stop drinking.

13
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,739
-Just a little more.
-Stop drinking. Have some food.

14
00:02:01,805 --> 00:02:02,609
Alright.

15
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:03,940
Your mouth is so oily.

16
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,020
Wipe your mouth.

17
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:06,539
Stop drinking.

18
00:02:08,658 --> 00:02:10,219
Wait. What are you doing?

19
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,119
Hey.

20
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,299
There's not much left.

21
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,060
-Just a little.
-Just a little?

22
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,465
-Yeah.
-Just a little, okay?

23
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,099
Only a little.

24
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:17,940
That's enough.

25
00:02:17,954 --> 00:02:19,355
That's too much.

26
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:22,500
Cheers.

27
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,939
You don't understand, right?

28
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:26,299
Cheers is what they say in English.

29
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,433
Cheers.

30
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:34,739
How much did you drink?

31
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,340
How did you get so drunk?

32
00:02:37,179 --> 00:02:39,060
I'll make some hangover soup for you.

33
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:18,770
Here.

34
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:20,620
Drink this.

35
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:29,019
Don't you know how much liquor

36
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,860
you can drink?

37
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:33,659
I'm teaching students in accordance

38
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,739
with their aptitude.

39
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,379
First, I lure her in with desire.

40
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:44,140
After that, I'll bring her to
the righteous path.

41
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,659
Tou Tou is a promising child.

42
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,060
It's just that it's difficult

43
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,819
to be her teacher.

44
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,420
Look at me.

45
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,420
I'm giving everything I got

46
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,060
to realise Master's dream.

47
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,140
I've never seen you put this much effort

48
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,220
in teaching Tian Zhen.

49
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:04,220
It's because I know

50
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,060
Tian Zhen

51
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,459
belongs here.

52
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:11,780
He can't run away.

53
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,380
But Tou Tou?

54
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:18,660
She might run away

55
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,859
if we take our eyes off her.

56
00:04:20,578 --> 00:04:21,418
I think

57
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:23,419
you're sure that I won't run away.

58
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,060
That's why you make
endless demands of me.

59
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,179
Dear, that sounds unfair to me.

60
00:04:29,299 --> 00:04:30,220
Unfair?

61
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,060
Was I wrong?

62
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,579
You put so much effort

63
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,259
in treating outsiders.

64
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:39,419
What about your family?

65
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,579
This is

66
00:04:44,299 --> 00:04:46,019
a common problem among humans.

67
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,660
We always show outsiders

68
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:50,019
our best side

69
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:52,979
and show our family members
our worst side.

70
00:04:58,419 --> 00:04:59,979
Don't think

71
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:01,859
that I invited Tou Tou to drink with me

72
00:05:01,859 --> 00:05:03,660
so that I could transform her.

73
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:06,699
I was cleaning up the mess
your son had made.

74
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,419
If so, why didn't you let him

75
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,060
treat the girl during the forum?

76
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,380
So, you were waiting
to say that all along?

77
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,739
I was wondering

78
00:05:17,739 --> 00:05:19,060
why everything

79
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,220
wasn't proceeding smoothly lately.

80
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,220
Your son wasn't ready yet.

81
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,579
If you don't let him give it a try,

82
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:26,940
he'll never be ready.

83
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,019
Both you

84
00:05:29,739 --> 00:05:31,019
and Uncle were around.

85
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,500
And, he wanted to send Tian Zhen
to give the girl a diagnosis.

86
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,780
He wanted to see how capable
Tian Zhen was.

87
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,620
You only look on the bright side.

88
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:42,780
What if your son

89
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:45,139
made things worse?

90
00:05:45,739 --> 00:05:46,859
If Tou Tou made things worse,

91
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,419
everyone could at least
come to terms with it.

92
00:05:49,739 --> 00:05:50,940
I could back her up.

93
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,940
But if I send your son there

94
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:54,419
and back him up,

95
00:05:54,859 --> 00:05:56,739
the Song family

96
00:05:56,739 --> 00:05:58,019
will be embarrassed.

97
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,419
I didn't send your son there

98
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,060
in order to protect him.

99
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,859
Goodness.

100
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:08,459
This concerns the girl's life, you know?

101
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:10,459
Listen.

102
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,419
I'll tell you this.

103
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:16,780
Although Tou Tou is boorish,

104
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,459
she's talented.

105
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,459
She's talented

106
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
and she's meant to take this path.

107
00:06:23,179 --> 00:06:24,780
She might be distracted

108
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,739
during our lessons,

109
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,060
however, she has a delicate heart.

110
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,100
Her eyes and ears were open
and receptive.

111
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,620
She remembered everything

112
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,380
I said and taught.

113
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,019
Not only did she observe what I taught,

114
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:39,856
but she could also apply them.

115
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,820
She observed that Mr Zheng's daughter

116
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,620
had eczema.

117
00:06:44,179 --> 00:06:45,019
When your son was there,

118
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,441
he only said

119
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,768
that she had a fever.

120
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:50,179
He may be able to cure her fever,

121
00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:51,739
but he'll never think of

122
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,820
making egg yolk oil on the scene

123
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,660
and letting the girl apply it.

124
00:06:55,859 --> 00:06:56,739
Do you think he'll think of that?

125
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,500
He'll never think of that.

126
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,940
The people there might have

127
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,820
a doctorate or a Master's degree,

128
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:03,780
but none of them

129
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,859
can do any better than Tou Tou.

130
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,900
You're excited and proud

131
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,299
when you talk about Sun Tou Tou.

132
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,259
You feel like throwing up again?

133
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,753
I'll go to the toilet.

134
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:29,179
Li Quan applied for leave again?

135
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,459
Yes, this is already the second time
this month.

136
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:32,299
And, he applied for leave once

137
00:07:32,299 --> 00:07:33,179
during our weekend lesson.

138
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,748
Tian Zhen,

139
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,060
did you know that Li Quan
applied for leave?

140
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,500
I know that.

141
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,842
Where did he go?

142
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,225
He...

143
00:07:43,859 --> 00:07:44,780
He's doing a part-time job.

144
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,820
A part-time job?

145
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:50,340
What does that mean?

146
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:53,005
He's doing foot massages.

147
00:07:53,116 --> 00:07:53,998
Dr Song,

148
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:55,459
someone left their belongings
in the storeroom.

149
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:56,317
Come and take a look.

150
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:05,859
Call Zhao Li Quan.

151
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,419
Tell him to pack his belongings.

152
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,940
How could he keep them here?

153
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,179
This is a medical centre, not a hotel.

154
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:16,660
The medicine we use
will be consumed by the patients.

155
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:21,179
Where will he stay then?

156
00:08:21,179 --> 00:08:22,060
Take his things out.

157
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,019
How is that my business?

158
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:27,033
Tian Zhen,

159
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,380
is Li Quan facing any difficulties?

160
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,019
I lent him my dorm last time.

161
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,579
But the dorm had tight security.

162
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:36,499
I told him to stay here
for the time being.

163
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:38,220
I think he's going to rent a unit soon.

164
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,059
That's why he applied for leave

165
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,900
in order to work outside.

166
00:08:41,619 --> 00:08:42,939
He should find a job

167
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,019
with stable income.

168
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,059
He can come and learn

169
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,139
when he has time.

170
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:51,300
If so, you can just give him a job.

171
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:53,499
Just make him a pharmaceutical worker.

172
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,180
He can prepare prescriptions.

173
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:56,860
He can study at the same time.

174
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,900
And, he'll make some money too.

175
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,860
Isn't that the best of both worlds?

176
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,100
Zhao Li Quan will be
a doctor in the future.

177
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:07,499
He can't just steal other people's jobs.

178
00:09:07,499 --> 00:09:08,340
Go and ask him.

179
00:09:09,619 --> 00:09:10,499
It's either he continues his study

180
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:11,946
or works outside.

181
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,619
You're discriminating against him here.

182
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,220
Why can Peng Shi Yan work
while studying then?

183
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:18,420
Why can't Zhao Li Quan do the same?

184
00:09:19,499 --> 00:09:21,340
Peng Shi Yan

185
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,740
doesn't make a living
as a TCM practitioner.

186
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,340
TCM is Zhao Li Quan's livelihood.

187
00:09:26,619 --> 00:09:27,740
He needs medical skills

188
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,619
to make a living, understood?

189
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:32,540
I think Tian Zhen's suggestion

190
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,259
is worth considering.

191
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:36,860
It might work.

192
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,660
If Li Quan is around,

193
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,379
at least he can help us out

194
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,780
when we're busy preparing prescriptions.

195
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,740
He's familiar with herbs and medicine.

196
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,499
And, he was professionally trained
in this field.

197
00:09:47,819 --> 00:09:49,540
He can prepare prescriptions

198
00:09:49,619 --> 00:09:50,699
when we give diagnoses.

199
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:52,579
He can study with the other classmates

200
00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:53,819
when there's a class.

201
00:09:53,939 --> 00:09:55,499
This is our place after all.

202
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:58,379
We can pay him according to
a part-timer's rate.

203
00:09:58,379 --> 00:09:59,340
What do you think?

204
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:01,619
Niece-in-law already said so much.

205
00:10:01,619 --> 00:10:02,459
Nephew,

206
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,259
why don't you consider it?

207
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,819
Why are you calling me Nephew again?

208
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:11,499
Because it's time for me
to show my authority as your senior.

209
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:21,340
I know you guys are
doing this for his sake.

210
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,420
But the thing is,

211
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,459
Zhao Li Quan

212
00:10:25,619 --> 00:10:28,059
must understand what he truly desires.

213
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:29,499
That's the main thing.

214
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:30,567
That's it for now.

215
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,364
Call him.

216
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,139
He can't stay here.

217
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:42,499
So, does that mean

218
00:10:42,499 --> 00:10:43,459
your father has agreed to it?

219
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:46,420
Your seniority does work wonders.

220
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,780
You've been applying for leave

221
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,939
just to work here?

222
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:04,104
Quit the job.

223
00:11:04,619 --> 00:11:06,459
You're a postgraduate student
from a decent medical academy.

224
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:08,619
Why are you working
in a massage parlour?

225
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,259
I'll get you a decent job.

226
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:11,180
-Come with me.
-Tian Zhen.

227
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:15,592
Thank you.

228
00:11:16,499 --> 00:11:17,860
You always helped me out.

229
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,059
I feel pretty bad about it.

230
00:11:19,619 --> 00:11:20,499
I appreciate your kindness,

231
00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:21,379
but I'm doing great here.

232
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:22,202
Doing great?

233
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:23,379
You apply for leave during the day.

234
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:24,699
You don't even attend
our lessons on the weekend.

235
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,860
My father was unhappy that
you applied for leave today.

236
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,059
Besides, if you work at night,

237
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:29,900
you won't have the energy to
attend class on the second day.

238
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,740
If there's a situation in your family,

239
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,699
-you can tell me.
-Tian Zhen.

240
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:33,539
I can help you out.

241
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:39,379
I know you're doing it for my sake.

242
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:42,980
But it's not like I can accept your help

243
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:46,300
every time without any pressure.

244
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:51,300
I'm a man too. I have my dignity.

245
00:11:51,499 --> 00:11:52,780
You said this yourself.

246
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,379
You said you would find a mentor
in the apprentice class

247
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:55,699
and ask them to take you
under their wing.

248
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:56,860
How could you learn from them

249
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,660
when you're doing this?

250
00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:00,860
I do want to get a mentor

251
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,059
and learn under them.

252
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:05,379
However, I need to survive first.

253
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,420
You saw this yourself.

254
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:09,420
I've always been working outside.

255
00:12:10,499 --> 00:12:11,619
It was different when I was in college.

256
00:12:11,619 --> 00:12:12,540
Back then, I was just
providing for myself.

257
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,420
I didn't need to provide for my family.

258
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,340
Now, it's different.

259
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,939
Now, I have to make money
and provide for my family.

260
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,340
Forget it. Let's drop the topic.

261
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,300
You won't understand anyway.

262
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,459
Your starting point is the endpoint
I've been trying to achieve.

263
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:24,740
Wait. What did you say?

264
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,180
-Wait.
-This is...

265
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,300
What are you guys saying?

266
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,740
You guys are going off-topic here.

267
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,019
It's way off-topic.

268
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:35,939
Is it that complicated?

269
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,579
Do you wish to find

270
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:39,180
a way for you to study

271
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,740
and make money at the same time?

272
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,300
Right now, there's such a deal.

273
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,499
It can satisfy your need to study

274
00:12:44,619 --> 00:12:46,300
and help you make money too.
Do you want it or not?

275
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,220
Why are you here?

276
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,619
Why the heck are you here?

277
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,220
Didn't you come here

278
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,619
to help your friend?

279
00:12:51,619 --> 00:12:53,540
You already arranged
something for him, right?

280
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,340
Just tell him.

281
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,379
Tell him everything.

282
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:57,220
Tell him both the pros and cons.

283
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,939
Let him make the call.

284
00:12:58,939 --> 00:13:00,860
He's the one making the call here,
not you.

285
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,139
Why are you acting like
you're his father?

286
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:05,059
But you!

287
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:06,059
You kept interrupting him

288
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:07,019
when he was trying

289
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,379
to tell you about it.

290
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,139
I was so fed up.

291
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,619
Can't you just wait for him
to finish his words

292
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:13,980
before you interrupt?

293
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,300
Just cut to the chase.

294
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,939
Don't talk about anything else.

295
00:13:22,939 --> 00:13:24,340
You can work as a pharmaceutical worker
in my family's medical centre.

296
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,220
You can attend class when there's one.

297
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:27,740
My father has already agreed to it.

298
00:13:32,499 --> 00:13:33,397
Thank you.

299
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,025
Thank you.

300
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:37,797
Don't mention it.

301
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:39,347
Yeah.

302
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,860
Here you go.

303
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:42,699
Isn't it simple?

304
00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:44,220
You guys would've argued

305
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,780
for three hours if I weren't here.

306
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:48,229
Quan,

307
00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:50,259
you might not be able to
live in the medical centre anymore.

308
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:51,268
That's fine.

309
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,980
I'll get my wage soon.

310
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,540
I'll stay in a cheap place
for the time being.

311
00:13:58,939 --> 00:13:59,822
Okay.

312
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,740
Fools.

313
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,046
Xing Xing.

314
00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:02,780
We meet again.

315
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,619
Dear,

316
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:05,540
you're here to pick me up?

317
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,340
Someone's following me.

318
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:17,991
Is he gone?

319
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,740
He should be gone.

320
00:15:27,699 --> 00:15:28,619
That was terrifying.

321
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,180
That guy followed me
all the way here from the subway.

322
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,379
He kept staring at me.

323
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,059
Listen. Next time, if you encounter
someone like him,

324
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:35,259
just stare at him.

325
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,100
People like him are timid.

326
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:38,499
I'm not Tou Tou.

327
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:39,980
I dare not stare at him.

328
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:46,379
What are you doing here?

329
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:50,216
I...

330
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,819
You must make sure
your centre of gravity

331
00:15:53,139 --> 00:15:54,980
is between your legs.

332
00:15:55,619 --> 00:15:56,516
Wait.

333
00:15:56,982 --> 00:15:58,420
Wait.

334
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:00,266
Who's calling you?

335
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:03,293
It's Xing Xing.

336
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,149
Hello?

337
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,860
Sun Tou Tou, what have you done?

338
00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:14,100
What do you mean
by sending a guy to my house?

339
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:16,059
Xing Xing,

340
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,059
it's pretty late now.

341
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:20,379
Have you taken dinner?

342
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,340
Did you work overtime again?

343
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,220
I'm sure it's tough on you.

344
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,619
I'm heartbroken.

345
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:27,139
Don't interrupt me.

346
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,235
Tell me.

347
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:29,619
You sent a man to my house.

348
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:30,660
What should I do?

349
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,139
(Xing Xing, listen.)

350
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:35,379
Quan is so pitiful.

351
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:37,059
Not only can he not afford food,

352
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:39,059
but he also
can't afford a place to stay.

353
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:41,059
(My bed is vacant anyway.)

354
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:42,340
(That's why I sent him there.)

355
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,860
(Can you take pity on him)

356
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,980
and take him in?

357
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,980
I promise.

358
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,459
He's a good guy.

359
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:49,740
He won't cross the line.

360
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,300
I don't know if he's a good guy or not,

361
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,420
but he's a guy.

362
00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:55,459
(That's even better.)

363
00:16:55,699 --> 00:16:58,139
I thought it was dangerous for you
to live alone.

364
00:16:58,379 --> 00:16:59,699
Now, there's a guy to protect you.

365
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,180
I can rest at ease now.

366
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,339
(And, Xing Xing, think about it.)

367
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,540
(He knows how to give massages.)

368
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,940
If you have issues like a stiff neck,

369
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,739
you don't even need to
go to the massage parlour.

370
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,900
Just stay at home.

371
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,460
First come, first served, right?

372
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,300
(Isn't it convenient?)

373
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:20,180
You'll land me in trouble eventually.

374
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,739
What? You expect me
to carry your luggage?

375
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,744
Slowly.

376
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:48,859
You must be careful when you go up.

377
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,180
-Come on.
-Let's continue.

378
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,739
Maintain your centre of gravity.

379
00:17:53,259 --> 00:17:54,085
Okay.

380
00:17:56,499 --> 00:17:57,820
Feel the harmony between man and nature.

381
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,029
Say,

382
00:18:08,739 --> 00:18:09,940
is chiropractic

383
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,820
the thing

384
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,739
where they pop the bones?

385
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,319
That's not it.

386
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,339
Ms Dong doesn't do that.

387
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:18,139
It's dangerous when
you crack bones like that.

388
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:19,580
No, that's not what I mean.

389
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,420
I mean popping the bones.

390
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,499
There's a sound to it.

391
00:18:21,499 --> 00:18:23,420
What's the difference between them?

392
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,820
Cracking

393
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,780
makes a different sound.

394
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,900
Popping makes a different sound.

395
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,859
That's the difference.

396
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,019
It's the same thing.

397
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:30,460
How could they be the same?

398
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,379
The difference is

399
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:34,139
that chiropractic is fake.

400
00:18:34,139 --> 00:18:35,660
It's a lie.

401
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,499
It's already good enough

402
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,180
for massages and the likes
to help our bodies to relax.

403
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,660
We mustn't abuse

404
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:43,739
the power of rumours.

405
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,580
It'll harm the people.

406
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:46,660
That's why I think

407
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,180
TCM practitioners
can focus on healthcare

408
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,580
while doctors can focus on treatments.

409
00:18:49,739 --> 00:18:50,619
We should stay on our designated trails.

410
00:18:50,619 --> 00:18:51,780
Isn't that better?

411
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,339
I don't know about the others,

412
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:55,019
but Ms Dong is a living deity.

413
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:56,180
If she does work her magic,

414
00:18:56,379 --> 00:18:58,259
you'll feel like you've been reborn.

415
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,339
I know her for many years.

416
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,259
I saw for myself

417
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:02,420
that patients in wheelchairs

418
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,060
could walk out of the room
after her treatment.

419
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,379
Guys, listen to him.

420
00:19:05,739 --> 00:19:07,540
She used her hand
to restore the position of the bones,

421
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,019
and that could achieve
the effect of surgeries.

422
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:11,700
Don't you think it's ridiculous?

423
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,379
Even doctors can't guarantee

424
00:19:13,379 --> 00:19:15,219
that a cripple could walk out of
the room after surgery.

425
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,435
Pick it up.

426
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,060
Look. He's resorting to this
when he can't win the argument.

427
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,180
You deserved it.

428
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,339
Shi Yan, you'd better believe it.

429
00:19:37,339 --> 00:19:39,379
There's an old lady called Luo You Ming
in Shuangqiao, Beijing.

430
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:40,780
She could set bones

431
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,780
with just her hands.

432
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:44,259
Premier Zhou even
built a hospital for her.

433
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,460
She could

434
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,499
set fractures, even crushed bones

435
00:19:48,571 --> 00:19:49,451
and restore them.

436
00:19:49,979 --> 00:19:51,259
Is that Ms Dong

437
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:53,219
as good as the old lady
in Shuangqiao, Beijing?

438
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,180
If that's the case, she's even better
than my nephew then.

439
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,660
Yeah.

440
00:19:57,019 --> 00:19:58,060
Is Mr Ren here?

441
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,739
This must be the classroom.

442
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,820
That's Zhu's car.

443
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,718
He's here?

444
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,379
Mr Ren!

445
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,300
I finally found you!

446
00:20:15,332 --> 00:20:16,298
Mr Zhu,

447
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,940
I thought we had an appointment
in the medical centre on Monday?

448
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,460
I couldn't sleep well

449
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,460
for the past few days.

450
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,339
(Zhu Chang Ming)
I was flustered.

451
00:20:22,379 --> 00:20:23,259
I couldn't wait any longer.

452
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,300
Mr Ren, please read my pulse.

453
00:20:26,285 --> 00:20:27,190
(Dong Hui Ci)
Check my pulse.

454
00:20:27,589 --> 00:20:28,453
Yeah.

455
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,619
I just received a batch of
top-quality cordyceps.

456
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,300
There are only 1,000 of them in one jin.

457
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,453
I bought 500,000 yuan
worth of cordyceps.

458
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,019
Should I consume it?

459
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,940
Or should I

460
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,540
consume the 60-years-old
wild ginseng I have?

461
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,370
What do you think?

462
00:20:40,998 --> 00:20:41,953
What about this?

463
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,780
You can tell us

464
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,180
the "tonics"

465
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,420
you think that are good for you

466
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,780
lately.

467
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,900
I took plenty of them.

468
00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:51,940
Turtles,

469
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,780
ginseng,

470
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,859
dendrobium, sea cucumbers,

471
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:54,780
I took everything.

472
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,940
So, do you feel better
after taking them?

473
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,139
Or do you feel uncomfortable?

474
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,900
It's like this.

475
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,700
I think it's only worth it

476
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,259
if I take such expensive tonics.

477
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:05,940
I make a lot of money.

478
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,900
What else should I spend them on
besides food?

479
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,940
So, you have too much money, huh?

480
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,780
You should do charity with them then.

481
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:13,180
You can donate to our apprentice class.

482
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,379
Mr Ren, it's like this.

483
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,460
I can't donate my money when I'm alive.

484
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,339
I'll donate everything to you

485
00:21:18,339 --> 00:21:19,940
once I'm dead.

486
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,300
Donating my money

487
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,780
is just like donating my organs.

488
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,300
I'll feel terrible.

489
00:21:25,379 --> 00:21:26,820
Zhu, you need to understand this.

490
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,900
Herbs and tonics are used

491
00:21:28,379 --> 00:21:30,300
to rectify a deviation.

492
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,300
Not all tonics can be consumed.

493
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,180
Judging from your current condition,

494
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,379
it's useless

495
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,580
to take any kind of tonics.

496
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,300
Even so, I have to take something.

497
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,420
Give me a prescription.

498
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,339
Give me a prescription.

499
00:21:41,379 --> 00:21:42,180
You?

500
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,700
Listen.

501
00:21:44,379 --> 00:21:46,540
Carrot and Chinese cabbages
are your best bet.

502
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,019
Seasonal and cheap ingredients

503
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:49,460
are best for you.

504
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,660
Just adjust your diet.

505
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,780
Take your meal on time
and sleep on time.

506
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,660
I can't sleep.

507
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,300
I wouldn't need to be here
if I could sleep in the first place.

508
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,542
What do you think?

509
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,139
Did you owe people money lately?

510
00:22:02,445 --> 00:22:03,269
No.

511
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,499
Did someone owe you money?

512
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,660
Are you afraid that
you can't get it back?

513
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,379
I can't treat that.

514
00:22:12,379 --> 00:22:13,420
Don't say that.

515
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,420
Mr Ren, you have to
do something about me.

516
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,379
You have to think of something.

517
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,060
You can't just ignore me.

518
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,060
What should I do then?

519
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:22,940
Give me a prescription.

520
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,259
Have you done some movements

521
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,180
that rotate your spine?

522
00:22:29,379 --> 00:22:30,900
What do you mean?

523
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,540
He plays golf.

524
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,259
Did you play golf for the past few days?

525
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,820
I play golf twice per week.

526
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,060
I stopped playing golf after last week

527
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,139
as I couldn't sleep.

528
00:22:41,139 --> 00:22:42,060
I didn't play golf this week.

529
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,820
Do you know something?

530
00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:45,540
When you play golf,

531
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,019
you're rotating your spine

532
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,780
with this movement.

533
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,300
This movement

534
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,979
caused your thoracic vertebra
to shift to the wrong position.

535
00:22:52,979 --> 00:22:55,060
And that has affected the function
of your lungs and heart.

536
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,139
That's why you couldn't sleep.

537
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,019
I'll restore them

538
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:00,259
to their original positions later.

539
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,180
You'll be able to sleep well tonight
after that.

540
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,499
You should give me a prescription.

541
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,739
If Ms Dong said she could treat you,

542
00:23:16,139 --> 00:23:17,940
she could definitely treat you.

543
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,420
Are you sure?

544
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,636
Guys,

545
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,619
for our chiropractic class,

546
00:23:29,619 --> 00:23:31,540
I've invited Ms Dong Hui Ci,

547
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,060
whom I respect a lot.

548
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:34,780
She bumped into

549
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,420
a patient at the entrance.

550
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,420
She's treating him right now.

551
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,820
That's why

552
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,099
I'm doing the introduction.

553
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,619
Ms Dong is here. Let's welcome her.

554
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,294
Ms Dong,

555
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,580
how's the patient?

556
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,499
He's asleep.

557
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,619
Professor Song is looking after him.

558
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,514
Guys,

559
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,940
for today's class,

560
00:23:56,379 --> 00:23:58,900
it'll definitely be interesting and fun.

561
00:23:59,139 --> 00:24:00,660
We'll show you guys

562
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,780
that not only can chiropractic
treat illness,

563
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,619
but it can also treat major illnesses.

564
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,979
Just now, that patient said

565
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,780
he had insomnia.

566
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,300
After Ms Dong's treatment,

567
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,180
he's already

568
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,099
fallen asleep.

569
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,795
Okay.

570
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,820
I'll leave this class

571
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:20,540
to Ms Dong.

572
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,420
Ms Dong, I'll go and check on him.

573
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,420
Please go ahead.

574
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,212
Okay.

575
00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:26,180
I always think that TCM practitioners
are mystifying things.

576
00:24:26,259 --> 00:24:28,259
Say, was that Mr Zhu acting just now?

577
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,060
I assume you think

578
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,660
that I requested Professor Ren
to stage an act

579
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,540
to show off the skills of my sect.

580
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,619
That's not it. Actually,

581
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,139
with our skills,

582
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,540
we can cure many illnesses.

583
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,700
Ms Dong, not only
do you know chiropractic,

584
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,940
but you can also read lips.

585
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,700
Hello, everyone.

586
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,379
In our daily lives,

587
00:24:55,499 --> 00:24:57,300
we'll often encounter situations

588
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,470
such as

589
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,139
moving a flower pot,

590
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,739
carrying a baby,

591
00:25:02,019 --> 00:25:04,060
wearing your pants with one leg,

592
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,619
or realising that you couldn't move

593
00:25:06,619 --> 00:25:07,940
after waking up

594
00:25:08,277 --> 00:25:09,172
from a nap.

595
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,580
That's what we call a twisted waist.

596
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,780
There are often patients

597
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,060
who experience stuffy chests,

598
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,420
dizziness,

599
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,859
or bedridden due to leg pain

600
00:25:23,139 --> 00:25:24,420
due to misalignment of the spine.

601
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,540
As the saying goes,

602
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,619
it takes a hundred days for the bone
to knit and tendons to heal.

603
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,820
Some people might look like
they've recovered

604
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,780
after lying down for some time.

605
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,460
But in reality,

606
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,019
it became the root of other illnesses.

607
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,060
Ever since smartphones

608
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,660
and laptops

609
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,739
became essential parts of our lives,

610
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,619
even as an extension

611
00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:49,180
of our organs,

612
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,139
I could conclude

613
00:25:51,379 --> 00:25:52,379
that spondylosis

614
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,900
would be a common occurrence

615
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:58,619
in the future.

616
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,820
However, such illness

617
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,060
can be treated easily

618
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,259
with our methods.

619
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,979
As long as you give us enough time,

620
00:26:08,019 --> 00:26:09,660
I can restore your spines

621
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:13,060
to their factory setting.

622
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,859
Ms Dong, you should sit down
and teach us.

623
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:20,979
Thank you.

624
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:25,139
However, chairs with wheels
underneath them

625
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,406
shouldn't be used.

626
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,339
Chairs like these

627
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:30,580
are one of the main reasons

628
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,580
of waist and

629
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,259
and spinal issues.

630
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,180
Chinese characters are very meaningful.

631
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,820
I wish to talk about the character

632
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,660
"Zuo".

633
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,454
Tian Zhen,

634
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,060
can you come here

635
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,060
and write it down?

636
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:46,886
Okay.

637
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,019
Look.

638
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:00,420
The character "Zuo"

639
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,619
has two people
sitting on top of the earth.

640
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,379
Why are there two people?

641
00:27:06,379 --> 00:27:09,060
To balance things out.

642
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,379
Why must it be on top of the earth?

643
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:14,019
Because it needs to be sturdy.

644
00:27:14,019 --> 00:27:16,660
For chairs with wheels like these,

645
00:27:17,379 --> 00:27:18,660
we need to use the strength

646
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,219
of our waist

647
00:27:21,219 --> 00:27:23,700
to prevent it from moving.

648
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:28,219
But when we sit on it

649
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,379
and wish to move from here

650
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,300
to there,

651
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,460
it requires us

652
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,180
to have strong core strength.

653
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,660
What if you don't have

654
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,099
strong core strength?

655
00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:40,420
What will you use then?

656
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,060
You'll use this part.

657
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,099
This is what we refer

658
00:27:45,139 --> 00:27:46,420
to as lumbar rotation.

659
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,219
It's this part.

660
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,379
This will cause

661
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,780
the spine to be misaligned easily.

662
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,780
So, for my sake,

663
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,940
I think it's better

664
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,780
to teach you guys while standing.

665
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,379
So, who has

666
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,580
waist issues

667
00:28:05,139 --> 00:28:06,180
among you all?

668
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,379
All of you?

669
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,700
Ms Dong, me.

670
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,235
Okay.

671
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,660
Tell me then.

672
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:18,286
Over here?

673
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,580
Why are all these things still here?

674
00:28:21,619 --> 00:28:23,139
Who are you? What do you need?

675
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,460
We'll be renovating the place soon.

676
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,940
We're here to take measurements.

677
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,259
What measurements?

678
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,780
I'm not talking to you.

679
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,979
Take me the person in charge.

680
00:28:29,979 --> 00:28:30,790
Wait.

681
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,540
Person in charge? That's me.

682
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,371
Let me see.

683
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,139
What is this?

684
00:28:38,139 --> 00:28:39,379
I'm the person in charge here.

685
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,660
Hello. It's like this.

686
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,180
Mr Liu told us

687
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,499
to renovate the place.

688
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,060
-Renovate the place?
-That's right.

689
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,139
I even brought the contract here.

690
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,681
Please take a look.

691
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,056
What about this?

692
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,499
Please wait here for a moment.

693
00:28:51,499 --> 00:28:52,820
I'll call Mr Liu.

694
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,859
Okay.

695
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,180
Let's go and take a look.

696
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,300
Wait here.

697
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,540
Take a break for now.

698
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,900
Guys, take a break.

699
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,460
Liu,

700
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,379
are you using the classroom

701
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:15,300
for

702
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,499
other purposes?

703
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,324
That's right.

704
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,379
I was just planning
to tell you about it.

705
00:29:20,379 --> 00:29:22,420
It's like this. I wish to renovate

706
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,580
the classroom.

707
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,739
After that, I'll rent it out.

708
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:27,826
That's different from
what we agreed upon.

709
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:31,540
(Professor, you need to understand
my feelings too.)

710
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,300
Back then, I lent you the place

711
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,139
so that we could

712
00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:36,300
cooperate

713
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,780
and create a win-win situation.

714
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:41,339
(But you're uninterested in
the TCM industrial park)

715
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:42,420
(and unwilling to join us.)

716
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,379
You see,

717
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,060
my capability and capital

718
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,820
is limited.

719
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:47,889
Besides,

720
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,379
I need to provide for

721
00:29:49,379 --> 00:29:50,660
my family

722
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,700
and the employees in my company.

723
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,900
I have to be responsible for them.

724
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,540
(It's tough to make a living nowadays.)

725
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,300
(If I do this, at least
I can collect some rent.)

726
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,139
You know this too. I'm passionate

727
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,900
toward TCM too.

728
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:04,820
But my dear friend,

729
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,660
this might sound harsh,

730
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,540
but we can't make a living
with sentiment alone.

731
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,420
(That's why I could only rent it out)

732
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,219
(after renovating it.)

733
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,940
I have to rent the dorm out too

734
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,940
if it's possible.

735
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,555
You understand?

736
00:30:19,668 --> 00:30:20,690
Fine then.

737
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,280
What about this?

738
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,631
So,

739
00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:40,339
you three can wait outside
for the time being.

740
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:41,540
Let me deal with them first.

741
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,219
-Alright.
-Thank you.

742
00:30:43,219 --> 00:30:44,057
Guys.

743
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:45,241
Please.

744
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,700
Ms Dong, it's like this.

745
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,300
For the hands-on technique class,

746
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,780
we have to suspend it for now.

747
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,485
Guys, listen up.

748
00:30:58,499 --> 00:31:00,060
The apprentice class

749
00:31:02,019 --> 00:31:03,580
will be suspended for the time being.

750
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:05,379
I'll notify you guys

751
00:31:05,379 --> 00:31:06,379
when our class reopens.

752
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,700
Charge!

753
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,900
Okay. Break.

754
00:31:13,139 --> 00:31:14,940
Ms Dong just told us

755
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,339
not to sit on this chair.

756
00:31:16,524 --> 00:31:17,426
Only for a while.

757
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,373
What's going on?

758
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,780
Why are we having a sudden break?

759
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,660
I think everything's fine.

760
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:23,739
Don't worry.
My father will deal with it.

761
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,546
Tou!

762
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,737
Come here.

763
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,180
-Hurry up.
-Be careful.

764
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,434
What?

765
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,540
For this year's Qixi Festival,

766
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,300
they'll hold a lantern party
at the old street.

767
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,580
Initially, we had class.

768
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,739
Since God has given us

769
00:31:36,739 --> 00:31:38,780
an excellent chance
by suspending our class,

770
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,619
why don't we head there
and enjoy ourselves?

771
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,664
You...

772
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:47,868
You should've told me

773
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,139
about this earlier.

774
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,700
I heard

775
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,219
that we could even rent Hanfu there.

776
00:31:52,219 --> 00:31:53,300
We should rent some Hanfu

777
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,540
and take some pictures
to commemorate the festival.

778
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,099
Who knows? Maybe this is our last class.

779
00:31:57,099 --> 00:31:57,984
Tou Tou,

780
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,859
don't jinx it.

781
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:00,728
Touch wood.

782
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,540
Meng Meng.

783
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,339
They're heading to the Qixi Festival
lantern party.

784
00:32:05,619 --> 00:32:06,460
Do you want to join them?

785
00:32:08,379 --> 00:32:09,820
But don't we need to apply for leave

786
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,060
from Mr Ren if we wish
to attend the event?

787
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,180
What leave?

788
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,379
-Mr Ren suspended the class.
-Yeah.

789
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,979
We don't even know
where the next class will be held at.

790
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:19,820
-Yeah.
-We should enjoy ourselves while we can.

791
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,700
That's right.

792
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,540
Let's go.

793
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,379
It's fun.

794
00:32:23,379 --> 00:32:24,780
There are all kinds of games there.

795
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,859
And, they'll sell your
favourite food too.

796
00:32:27,139 --> 00:32:27,985
I'll go there with you.

797
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,208
Do you want to join them?

798
00:32:30,987 --> 00:32:31,815
Okay.

799
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,099
Why are you guys still standing there?

800
00:32:33,099 --> 00:32:34,259
Go and pack your things.

801
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:35,060
Let's go.

802
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,241
Hurry up!

803
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,314
Rebecca,

804
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,739
you should come with us
to the Qixi Festival lantern party.

805
00:32:50,019 --> 00:32:51,700
No, thanks. I'm not interested.

806
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,060
I advise you guys not to attend it.

807
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:54,940
Although we have a holiday,

808
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,300
we still have curfews.

809
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,180
Aren't you afraid that someone
might wreck the place?

810
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,060
Someone needs to
keep an eye on the place.

811
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,540
What? Do you want to defend
this place with your life?

812
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,219
I suggest you join us

813
00:33:05,219 --> 00:33:07,300
so that you won't receive
any physical damage.

814
00:33:08,467 --> 00:33:09,387
I'm not afraid.

815
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,820
Even if I do sustain damage,

816
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:13,139
Ms Dong will cure me.

817
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,267
Fine.

818
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,660
Later, we'll have dinner

819
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,300
at 7pm. Remember to
keep an eye on the group chat.

820
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,780
Okay? 7pm.

821
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,660
Remember, it's 7pm.

822
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,819
Don't forget.

823
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,778
Isn't this adorable?

824
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,820
You want that?

825
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,606
I'll get it for you.

826
00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:09,379
Mister, how much does it cost?

827
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,020
Mister, I'll pay for it. Scan my code.

828
00:34:11,378 --> 00:34:12,699
Thank you, Mr Tian Zhen.

829
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,618
I'll get it for you.

830
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,779
Give me another one.

831
00:34:45,299 --> 00:34:46,229
Here I go.

832
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,660
Tou, you are terrible at this.

833
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,900
-You scared me. What?
-Give them to me.

834
00:34:55,579 --> 00:34:56,900
-Can you do it?
-Here you go.

835
00:35:02,819 --> 00:35:03,674
He got it!

836
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,220
Not bad at all.

837
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,660
Do you even know how to play the game?

838
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,531
Meng Meng,

839
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,980
I'm not very good at this.

840
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,579
However, I'm great at
playing claw machines.

841
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,299
If you want a plush toy,

842
00:35:16,299 --> 00:35:17,379
I can get you

843
00:35:17,379 --> 00:35:18,539
the toy you want.

844
00:35:18,539 --> 00:35:19,460
It's hard to say.

845
00:35:19,779 --> 00:35:20,779
We can do it too.

846
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:21,980
What are you

847
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,819
saying?

848
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,900
-You want to play?
-Yeah.

849
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,740
I'm good at this. Come.

850
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,900
It's impossible.

851
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,180
Listen, I'll get it on my first try.

852
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,460
You're just wasting your money.

853
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,500
That's impossible. Look.

854
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,500
Let me show you.

855
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,020
Senior,

856
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,460
I don't think I can do that.

857
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,940
(You own many companies
in the tertiary industry.)

858
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,779
Is it that hard for me
to get a classroom?

859
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,986
That's not the hard part.

860
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,579
The hard part is to pacify the people.

861
00:35:55,299 --> 00:35:56,779
You see, if I'm giving you
what you want now,

862
00:35:57,099 --> 00:35:58,034
what should I do

863
00:35:58,539 --> 00:35:59,539
when other people ask me
for the same thing?

864
00:36:00,139 --> 00:36:01,660
If I don't give it to them,
I'll be biased.

865
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,420
(You and I are from the same sect.)

866
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:04,900
(Just one report letter)

867
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,180
(is enough to land me in trouble.)

868
00:36:06,779 --> 00:36:08,180
I thought you promised

869
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,260
Fellow Zhang

870
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,020
that your academy would help us out

871
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,379
if we were in trouble?

872
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,500
Now, the apprentice class
is in a pickle here.

873
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,660
How do you plan to resolve the issue?

874
00:36:17,621 --> 00:36:18,555
Me?

875
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,299
At most, I can hold one,

876
00:36:22,299 --> 00:36:23,156
two,

877
00:36:23,589 --> 00:36:24,589
or even three seminars for you.

878
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:27,339
(But now, you're asking me
for a classroom.)

879
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:29,020
And, you'll be using it
for quite a few years.

880
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,460
The thing is,
you're not paying rent for it.

881
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,940
How can I explain myself
to the higher-ups?

882
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,900
What about this?

883
00:36:37,452 --> 00:36:38,932
For the sake of your apprentice class,

884
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,539
I'll sacrifice my career.

885
00:36:43,139 --> 00:36:44,740
I'll resign

886
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,579
(and be the class teacher)

887
00:36:46,819 --> 00:36:48,099
(for the apprentice class.)

888
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,660
I'll be thick-skinned and go out
to ask for donations.

889
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,420
What do you think?

890
00:36:53,565 --> 00:36:54,434
Stop your pointless chatter.

891
00:36:56,325 --> 00:36:57,175
Fine.

892
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,954
I'll think of something myself.

893
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,500
Your lot

894
00:37:20,619 --> 00:37:24,779
is the best out of all.

895
00:37:25,299 --> 00:37:26,579
That's all?

896
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,779
Is this a good thing or a bad thing?

897
00:37:30,779 --> 00:37:32,500
-I didn't get it.
-Yeah. Tell us the details.

898
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,379
-Is it good or bad?
-Late bloomer.

899
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,460
How late is late?

900
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:44,339
According to how
modern people calculate age,

901
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,139
it'll be around 60 years old.

902
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:50,980
60 years old?

903
00:37:51,859 --> 00:37:53,139
That's pretty good.

904
00:37:53,379 --> 00:37:54,500
People always seek out

905
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,940
senior TCM practitioners.

906
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,770
That's not it.

907
00:37:56,859 --> 00:37:57,700
Both of my parents

908
00:37:57,819 --> 00:37:58,740
made a name for themselves

909
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,819
at a young age.

910
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:00,740
But I'm only making a name
for myself at 60?

911
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,819
Do you think that's appropriate?

912
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,099
Yeah.

913
00:38:03,099 --> 00:38:05,220
Why not? I think it's good enough
to make a name for yourself.

914
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,539
Look at me.

915
00:38:06,539 --> 00:38:07,859
I'll stay like this
for the rest of my life.

916
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,940
I'm the same even when I'm 80.

917
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,059
Are you trying

918
00:38:11,477 --> 00:38:12,351
to console me?

919
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,099
I don't think so.

920
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,500
Let's check out the other stalls.

921
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,560
Alright.

922
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:24,323
-Let's check them out.
-They're selling food.

923
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:25,916
-Meng Meng, let's go.
-Let's go.

924
00:38:26,077 --> 00:38:26,935
Let's go.

925
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,613
Excuse me.

926
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,059
Let me ask you something.

927
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:40,900
Are you a human or a robot?

928
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,020
Sir, what other questions do you have?

929
00:38:45,932 --> 00:38:47,412
It's fine. Thank you.

930
00:38:52,779 --> 00:38:53,660
One of them

931
00:38:53,899 --> 00:38:55,139
is a late bloomer

932
00:38:55,339 --> 00:38:56,500
while the other one is a prodigy.

933
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:08,020
What should we do now?

934
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:09,819
I just feel apologetic

935
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:11,619
toward Ms Dong.

936
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,619
You always led a reclusive life.

937
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:15,879
Now,

938
00:39:16,588 --> 00:39:17,908
you're here.

939
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,339
But we don't even have a classroom
for you to teach them.

940
00:39:20,379 --> 00:39:21,859
Yeah, it's all my fault.

941
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,020
I should've expected this to happen

942
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,260
when I severed my ties

943
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,900
with them.

944
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,420
Actually, they're not obliged

945
00:39:28,692 --> 00:39:29,972
to help us out

946
00:39:30,148 --> 00:39:31,628
for free.

947
00:39:32,085 --> 00:39:33,204
Businessmen

948
00:39:33,707 --> 00:39:35,788
value profit over righteousness.

949
00:39:36,844 --> 00:39:37,844
That's a hasty generalization.

950
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,299
There are many
righteous businessmen too.

951
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:44,861
Master,

952
00:39:45,235 --> 00:39:46,836
you always told me

953
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:48,500
that if I have an idea,

954
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:49,859
everything will fall into place.

955
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:51,059
I had this idea

956
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,700
for a long time.

957
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,180
Why isn't anyone

958
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,740
giving me a classroom?

959
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,539
You see,

960
00:39:57,539 --> 00:39:58,900
that only works

961
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,260
when you're Buddha.

962
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,339
You still have a long way to go.

963
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:03,220
You're right.

964
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,740
You see,

965
00:40:06,267 --> 00:40:07,668
knowledge and action
should go hand in hand.

966
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,819
From realising
the righteousness of the event

967
00:40:11,059 --> 00:40:12,660
to the completion of the event,

968
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,573
everything else in between

969
00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:15,299
acts as your trial.

970
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,180
God is giving you an ordeal

971
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,180
called The Dignity Ordeal.

972
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,700
Master, you're right.

973
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,500
Master, I'll be honest with you.

974
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,339
In the past, I didn't think

975
00:40:31,059 --> 00:40:32,339
that this industry was that tough.

976
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:34,260
But now, it's...

977
00:40:36,579 --> 00:40:37,500
Think about it.

978
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,940
Throughout your career,

979
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,740
you were talented

980
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,139
and you had academic qualifications.

981
00:40:44,139 --> 00:40:44,988
And,

982
00:40:45,299 --> 00:40:46,900
you had elders like us

983
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,020
backing you up.

984
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,379
Of course you had a smooth journey.

985
00:40:50,539 --> 00:40:51,407
You're right.

986
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:52,539
Now,

987
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:55,020
I'm old.

988
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,420
I'm afraid I won't be able
to back you up anymore.

989
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,180
I'm afraid you need to back me up

990
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,180
in the future.

991
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,900
Dad, such chatter is meaningless.

992
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:08,059
Now, we need to figure out a way

993
00:41:08,059 --> 00:41:09,460
to resolve this issue.

994
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,700
Yeah.

995
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,180
Ms Dong,

996
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,500
I'm truly sorry.

997
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,500
We invited you all the way here,

998
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,610
however,

999
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,500
we don't even have a place

1000
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,700
for you to teach them.

1001
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:22,819
That's fine.

1002
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,460
When we decide

1003
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,460
to take the righteous path,

1004
00:41:29,059 --> 00:41:30,379
we have to put in much more effort

1005
00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:32,779
than taking the back door.

1006
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,819
God will test you

1007
00:41:34,819 --> 00:41:36,020
repeatedly

1008
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,020
to see

1009
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,779
whether you're truly sincere
in taking this path.

1010
00:41:42,651 --> 00:41:43,559
If you can pass God's test

1011
00:41:44,059 --> 00:41:45,619
every time without changing your goal,

1012
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,059
you'll achieve what you wish for.

1013
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,660
In my opinion,

1014
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:53,059
this isn't even

1015
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:54,779
an ordeal for you.

1016
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:56,674
You're

1017
00:41:56,779 --> 00:41:58,059
an academician.

1018
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,579
You published books and
made a name for yourself.

1019
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:03,339
But people like us?

1020
00:42:03,859 --> 00:42:04,900
It's quite difficult for us

1021
00:42:05,819 --> 00:42:07,700
to pass our legacy
to the next generation.

1022
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:10,420
In Taoism,

1023
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,900
masters will look for
their own disciples.

1024
00:42:12,819 --> 00:42:14,500
I agreed to join your class

1025
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,500
not because to help you out.

1026
00:42:17,059 --> 00:42:18,579
I'm helping myself out.

1027
00:42:19,524 --> 00:42:20,406
I was thinking

1028
00:42:20,652 --> 00:42:21,652
that I'll encounter a disciple

1029
00:42:22,109 --> 00:42:24,268
who's a kindred spirit
if I teach enough classes.

1030
00:42:25,299 --> 00:42:26,619
Maybe that person is willing
to inherit our legacy

1031
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:30,139
without changing anything.

1032
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,713
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

1033
00:42:34,801 --> 00:42:36,316
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

1034
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,134
(Do not use without medical advice)
