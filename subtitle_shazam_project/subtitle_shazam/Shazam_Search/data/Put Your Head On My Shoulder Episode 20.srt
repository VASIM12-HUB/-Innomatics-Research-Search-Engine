Gu Weiyi.

24
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,360
Gu Weiyi, did you bring a cone shell out with you?

25
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,270
I'm going to be late! I–!

26
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,880
- What are you doing?
- Going to work. I'm going to be late!

27
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,150
I took a day off for you.

28
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,360
- Really?
- Really.

29
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,210
Then I'm going to go back to sleep.

30
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,150
What's that on your neck?

31
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,920
Alcohol rash? I'm a bit allergic to alcohol.

32
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,430
If you knew you were allergic, why did you still drink so much?

33
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,240
I didn't do it on purpose.

34
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,900
You drank until you got to that state when I wasn't there. What were you thinking?

35
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,010
It was a work requirement.

36
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,190
I swear! I won't drink anymore. No matter what.

37
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,370
Even if I'm going to be fired.

38
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,410
Your face is like a scantron form and you reek of alcohol.

39
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,180
Am I?

40
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,350
You can't go to that kind of occasion in the future.

41
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,560
And don't contact that male celebrity as often anymore, got it?

42
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,910
Hurry and take a shower. I'm going to buy breakfast.

43
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,580
I want the fried dough sticks from the first breakfast store,

44
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,720
bean milk from the third store. I want peanut milk, not soybean milk.

45
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,800
- Go take a shower.
- Yes, Sir!

46
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,890
- You're back?
- Yeah.

47
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,920
Did you buy the peanut milk?

48
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,790
I bought it.

49
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,930
Come and eat breakfast.

50
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,710
Wait a moment.

51
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:26,710
What are you washing? Go eat breakfast, I'll help you–

52
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,530
What are you doing?

53
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,610
This... This i-is... my...

54
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:39,350
I know!  It fell to the ground. I rinsed it for you before hanging it up again.

55
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,070
N-No need.

56
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,220
It's fine. Didn't you wash it before you hung it up? It's not like it wasn't washed.

57
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,090
I know. Go eat breakfast.

58
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,900
Do you want one?

59
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,650
No.

60
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,900
- Do you want a sip?
- No.

61
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,320
I have a younger brother in my family. I hang up all of our laundry.

62
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,150
I'm used to it.

63
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:38,320
That's why there's no need to be shy.

64
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,860
I have no evil thoughts.

65
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:50,300
We've slept together in the same bed and nothing happened.

66
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,540
There's indeed no difference with my younger brother.

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,290

I have low blood sugar.

79
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:05,240
Isn't your body too weak?

80
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,390
You couldn't even stand up from having low blood sugar.

81
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:16,430
Your body is so weak and you still don't like exercising.

82
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,510
You're really not that different from my younger brother.

83
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,570
I didn't say anything. I didn't say anything.

84
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:30,430
I'm warning you. Don't say that I'm not any different from your younger brother.

85
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:34,390
There is a difference. There is definitely a difference.

86
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,770
What's the difference?

87
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:41,890
You... You...

88
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,220

What?

00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,230

Let's go out and talk.

92
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,960
How about you wait in your room? I'll call you when it's done.

93
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,160
I'll watch you cook.

94
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:00,240
The water needs some time to boil, how about–?

95
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,040
I'll wait here.

96
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,450
Okay, wait here then. Call me when the water boils.

00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,430
Can I just give the money and not go?

174
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:55,310
- What do you think?
- I say yes.

175
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:58,000
I say that you can't. Let's go.

176
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,290
- Are there more?
- Yes.

177
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,280
- There's more?
- Please wait a moment.

178
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,220
Did you order too much? This restaurant is quite expensive. Do you have enough money?

179
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,290
I do. I've already calculated it.

180
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,000
What have you calculated?

181
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,260
- Mo Mo!
- Mo Mo.

182
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,930
Wow!

183
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,460
Why do I think Gu Weiyi is richer

184
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,950
than your Fu Pei, the rich second generation?

185
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,440
Sit down! Sit down! Don't talk while standing. Sit.

186
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,080
Mo Mo, you understand me.

187
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:52,480
Gu Weiyi, what you've ordered here

188
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,520
are all my favorites.

189
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,050
You ordered so much, we can't finish them.

190
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:01,100
Youthful one, don't easily say "no" when you're faced with good food.

191
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,830
Also, we can pack it for takeaway if we can't finish it.

192
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,890
Niu Niu, what happened to your diet plan?

193
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:11,150
Don't you know that when dieting, you need to eat as much as you can in moderation

194
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:14,190
to cheat your body, that you're still the same fatty

195
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,300
so that your body will give you the same rate of metabolism?

196
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,010
Otherwise, the rate of metabolism is going to go down.

197
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:21,870
All right!  All right! Stop talking, let's start eating. Move those chopsticks!

198
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,580
Eat more.

199
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,920
Come find me after you're finished.

200
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,930
[Okay]

201
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,520
Don't be shocked. Eat.

202
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:57,150
- You've never been to this place, right?
- No.

203
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,840
This place isn't bad.

204
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,880
Quite comfortable.

205
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:06,220
Brat, stop playing with your phone.

206
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,330
This is your classmate from your school, Lu Jianshi.

207
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,770
Student Lu is a pillar of the country. She's a talent that's returned from abroad.

208
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,720
She specialized in studying quantum force.

209
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,140
It's quantum mechanics.

210
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,380
Let's order dishes first. Let's order.

211
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,450
Waitress.

212
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,260
What's the most expensive dish you have here?

213
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,230
- I have an important guest with me today.
- Fish.

214
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,050
How expensive could fish be?

215
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:39,910
Do you know how to recommend dishes? Tell your manager to come here.

216
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:43,520
Mister, our fish is all flown in by air from Canada.

217
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,600
I don't care where it was flown in from.

218
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,030
I just want the most expensive dish.

219
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,310
¥3,800 (US$543) for each tael (50 grams).

220
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,890
I guess it doesn't have to be that expensive.

221
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:00,720
Thank you. Give us one catty (500 grams) of that fish.

222
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,480
Jianshi, do you think that we should order that fish?

223
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,120
I'm fine with anything.

224
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,160
Then I think there is every need to eat this fish today.

225
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,120
That's how it can show my dad's love to you.

226
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,800
Right, Dad?

227
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,340
Give us one catty then.

228
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:29,530
- Bill, please.
- Just a moment.

229
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,390
A total of ¥3,453. 
(approx. $495.70)

230
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,770
How much?

231
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,680
¥3,453.

232
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,560
What did we eat that's that expensive? Are you tricking us?

233
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,040
Miss, do you want to check the receipt?

234
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,950
- There's no need.
- Why is there no need? There must be a problem.

235
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:48,040
The red wine was ¥899, marbled beef was ¥298,

236
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,410
- Yangtze Grenadier Anchovy was ¥1,100.
- This...this...

237
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,080
What fish was ¥1,100?

238
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,970
Yangtze Grenadier Anchovy.

239
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,100
Do you mean the dish filled with pineapple mixed with four to five pieces of sweet and sour fish?

240
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,530
¥7,800 for one catty.

241
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:14,400
Gu Weiyi, are you insane? ¥7,800 for one catty of fish?

242
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,220
Miss, ¥7,800 for one carry of fish is not that expensive.

243
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:23,040
The restaurant next door has fish flown in by air from Canada selling for ¥3,800 for one tael.

244
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:26,580
I was worried that you'd think I was being stingy with your friends.

245
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,120
Also, I didn't buy the one that's ¥3,800 for one tael.

246
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:36,420
If you paid ¥3,800 for one tael, I'd go home and dismantle Yuan Yuan!

247
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:41,030
Mister. Miss. Are you able to pay the bill now?

248
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,700
Should I get a receipt for you then?

249
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,290
No. Do you have enough money? I have some.

250
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,750
I do. I calculated it perfectly.

251
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,280
- Can I use WeChat?
- Yes.

252
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:01,940
"Your card with numbers ending in 071 paid ¥3,453 on June 8th at 8:00.

253
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,270
"Remaining amount ¥0.12."

254
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,730
You really did calculate it perfectly.

255
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:17,310
We've only been eating the fish.

256
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:20,110
I didn't even properly introduce my son to you.

257
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:24,040
He is studying management at the same school as you.

258
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,180
He has quite good grades. He plays basketball well, too.

259
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,520
But I already have a girlfriend.

260
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,960
She is prettier than Miss Lu, too.

261
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:38,380
She seems to be much prettier.

262
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:41,780
Hello, Uncle. Hello.

263
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:55,460
I'll ceremoniously introduce her to you two. This is my girlfriend, Wang Shan.

264
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,270
What nonsense are you speaking? I don't agree with it!

265
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,950
Why do you care?

266
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:05,160
Did China's education system not teach you that there should be respect in people's interactions?

267
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:10,590
Mutual respect? Miss Lu, I didn't hear it wrong, did I?

268
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:14,630
When you were eating fish that cost tens of thousands, were you thinking of respect?

269
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:18,460
Seems like the "respect" that they teach overseas isn't worth much either.

270
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,150
Today's meal wasn't bad. Luxurious.

271
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,070
I'm satisfied.

272
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:26,540
I'll be leaving first with my girlfriend then.

273
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:31,670
Stop right there! If you dare step out that door, just you try!

274
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,730
You're rebelling, you!

275
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,520
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

276
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,840
Look at you! Look at you! You don't even act like a man!

277
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,340
How did I get such a good-for-nothing son like you?!

278
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,160
Uncle, you're not in a good mood today,

279
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,670
so I won't introduce myself in detail today.

280
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:05,520
I'll come and visit you with Fu Pei next time.

281
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,530
Fu Pei, let's leave.

282
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,580
Fu Pei! Fu Pei!

283
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,620
What is it?

284
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:35,350
N-Nothing. I just found it funny.

285
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:40,060
Didn't you see my dad's expression? He nearly died from anger.

286
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,800
Did I go overboard just now?

287
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,480
But your dad's attitude to you...

288
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,380
No, it was really good.

289
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,340
Let's go.

290
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:11,360
I'm so hungry.

291
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,560
- Here.
- I don't want to drink water anymore.

292
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,370
I can't drink anymore.

293
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,270
I think that we're going to die if we continue like this.

294
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,840
Then let's eat a pack of instant noodles.

295
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,240
You dare to?

296
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:02,190
We finished up a month's spending on a meal. That's our last pack of instant noodles.

297
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:07,430
My scholarship will be sent before we graduate.

298
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:11,220
Can't we use my money?

299
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,950
No.

300
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:17,530
Are we going to drink and eat wind before you get the scholarship money?

301
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,230
There will be a solution.

302
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:24,360
But if we don't eat that pack of instant noodles now,

303
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,760
we won't make it to our graduation photos.

304
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:34,290
Fine.

305
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,050
It smells so good.

306
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:43,830
Not only does it smell good, but there's also a surprise, too.

307
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,670
Where did it come from?

308
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:59,280
When I was looking for a pack of instant noodles in the fridge, I found it stuck in the gap inside the fridge.

309
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,820
So, I put it in as well.

310
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,260
You eat it.

311
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:14,520
You eat it.

312
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,630
You should eat it.

313
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:23,110
There's only one, so you can have it.

314
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,490
You eat it. I'm not hungry.

315
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:32,090
Here–

316
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,670
Don't waste it. Don't waste it.

317
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,530
Eat the noodles.

318
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,960
Eat more vegetables.

319
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,360
Eat more, eat more of this.

320
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,720
It tastes so good.

321
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:04,680
Is it delicious?

322
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:18,930
Where did the egg go?

323
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:22,290
Where did it go? Where is it?

324
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:27,230
Eat the noodles. Eat more.

325
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:30,000
Drink more of the soup; it'll fill your stomach.

326
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:43,300
It's so delicious.

327
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,830
Do you know how to tie a tie?

328
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:35,500
I-I was about to ask you.

329
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:53,720
I remember the way they tied it in the video is similar to tying a red scarf.

330
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,040
It should go around here and...

331
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,830
Isn't it like that?

332
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:09,440
Around like this and then around like this...go around like this.

333
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,400
Just tie it however. We're going to be late.

334
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,360
Don't rush me, I can tie it.

335
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,110
It's starting to look like the shape of a tie.

336
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,630
Okay, okay, okay!

337
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:44,290
- Okay! Job done!
- I'll tie it for you.

338
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:48,200
I'll ask Lu Lu to tie it for me at school. Let's go!

339
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:10,490
[Sending off the graduates of 2018, come back home to visit often.]

340
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,320
[From a student card to an alumni card, continue to study a lot even after you graduate.]

341
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:23,870
[Auntie's hand wasn't shaking, she wants you to be thin, you're cooking for yourself from now on, eat less.]

342
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,010
[Waving goodbye, open your sails and sail far.]
[Put what you've learned to good use, connect the hearts of the world]

343
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:32,790
Stay up late less, your health is important.
[Lights won't be turned off by force anymore, but you still should sleep early]

344
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,890
Hey, Lu Lu.

345
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:40,050
Are you excited to see Ah Ke in a graduation gown?

346
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:43,400
Ah Ke already took a photo and showed me. What I'm most expectant of now

347
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,240
is what Gu Weiyi and Fu Pei look like in a graduation gown.

348
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,880
The two of them have such small faces and long legs,

349
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,680
they will surely be handsome.

350
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,490
You can only look at Mo Mo's man, don't look at my man.

351
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:55,050
- I'm going to look. I want to look at both.
- I want to see, too.

352
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,840
Shan Shan!

353
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,250
- Fu Pei!
- Shan Shan!

354
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,220
Is this the school grass (most handsome guy) from our school?

355
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,950
It feels like his IQ is really low.

356
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:10,160
- Who has low IQ?
- It's you.

357
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:17,120
I have something to give to you.

358
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,310
Ta-da! Were you surprised?

359
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,100
Was it prickly when you put it inside?

360
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,910
- It was. But I held it in.
- Prick you, prick you.

361
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:26,780
- Exactly.
- Was it prickly?
- As long as you're happy.

362
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,580
Lu Lu! Lu Lu! Tie my tie for me!

363
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,590
- Hold this for me for a moment.
- They smell nice.

364
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,940
- You know how to tie it, right?
- I do!

365
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,790
Why do you guys have graduation gowns?

366
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,720
We got it for you.

367
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,520
- I'll change into it in the dorms then.
- Where are you? Come to the lab quickly for photos.

368
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,730
Okay. I'll go there now.

369
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,950
- Do you know how to tie it?
- I do!
- I'm going to the lab first.

370
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:53,420
- I'll come here to meet up later.
- Okay.

371
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:58,710
Wait. I have a graduation photo plan.

372
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:01,710
That way, we won't miss every scene that we have memories of.

373
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:04,570
I realize that you're doing things with plans more and more now.

374
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:08,430
- Of course. Why don't you look at who's teaching me so well?
- Let me see.

375
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:11,560
[Everyone is waiting for you, hurry up.]
 I made an electronic version too. I'll send them to your phones later.

376
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,340
- Zhou Lei keeps rushing me. I'm leaving first.
- Go ahead.

377
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,640
- See you later.
- Bye-bye.

378
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,280
Why did your boyfriend leave right after coming? Does he have a woman hidden at the lab?

379
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:26,010
- Don't say anymore. They do have a really pretty senior at the lab.
- Lu Lu!

380
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:29,270
What kind of pretty girls could there be at the lab?

381
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:35,570
I swear!  The gods are watching. I was just curious.

382
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:38,660
Also, I heard that she really likes Gu Weiyi.

383
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,250
It's not like what you're thinking.

384
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:44,480
Mo Mo, you're so understanding now.

385
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,720
Look at Gu Weiyi, he didn't even give you a flower.

386
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,760
Exactly. Look at Fu Pei.

387
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,700
For Wang Shan, he got his chest pricked.

388
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,770
He didn't remember. You guys don't have flowers either, right?

389
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:56,420
- I do. I have flowers in my heart.
- In my heart.

390
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:00,500
In your heart... All right! Go, go, go! Let's go take photos!

391
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,290
- Shan Shan, sit tight.
- Let's go take photos!

392
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:05,970
Let's go.

393
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,850
Why are you so heavy?

394
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,710
[To be continued, there are easter eggs...]

396
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,290
I'm so full.

397
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:38,740
We're going to take graduation photos soon.

398
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,310
If you continue eating like this, I'm not going to photoshop for you.

399
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:43,910
I'll ask Mo Mo to help me then.

400
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,900
We've made you spend a lot today. Sorry.

401
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,590
The meal we meant was a barbecue.

402
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:52,900
We didn't think you were going to be so honest. Since you were being so honest,

403
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,780
we'll be honest with you, too.

404
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,780
Save me, Shan Shan! Let go of your hands!

405
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,160
- Situ Mo's ears are really sensitive.
- Save me!

406
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:05,160
This meal was well-spent, right?!

407
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,100
- What did she say?
- She didn't say anything.

408
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,750
I'm leaving first. Thanks for the meal.

409
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:12,570
- Take care!
- Got it.

410
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:16,070
- What did they say to you?
- Nothing.

411
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:18,440
Nothing? What did they really say to you?

412
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,910
I told you, it was nothing.

413
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:22,070
I don't believe it.

414
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:25,760
- Stop asking.
- Then, why are you blushing?

415
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:33,040
From the perspective of biology, the secretion of adrenaline will cause blood to flow to the capillaries in the surface of the skin.

416
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,550
- The expansion of the capillaries at the surface of the skin will–
- Enough. Don't say anything anymore.
