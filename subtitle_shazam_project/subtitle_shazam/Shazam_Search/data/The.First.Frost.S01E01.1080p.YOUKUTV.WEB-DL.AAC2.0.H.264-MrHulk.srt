186
00:10:51,023 --> 00:10:52,783
That handsome figure from behind.

187
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:53,983

188
00:10:58,533 --> 00:10:59,653
Enough, stop staring.

189
00:11:01,463 --> 00:11:02,263
Sorry!

190
00:11:02,983 --> 00:11:04,103
How could you be so careless?

191
00:11:04,103 --> 00:11:04,893
It's fine.

192
00:11:05,293 --> 00:11:06,573
I'll go to the restroom to clean it up.

193
00:11:06,573 --> 00:11:07,743
It could be washed off, right?

194
00:11:08,053 --> 00:11:09,023
I'm so sorry.

195
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:10,933
Sorry.

196
00:11:10,933 --> 00:11:11,773
It's okay.

197
00:11:27,683 --> 00:11:31,443
♪The dust of lies and your wounds♪

198
00:11:31,563 --> 00:11:34,883

204
00:12:05,173 --> 00:12:06,503
I saw you earlier.

205
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:25,463
Change into it.

206
00:12:26,463 --> 00:12:27,413
I'm the boss here.

207
00:12:27,863 --> 00:12:28,533
My surname is Sang.

208
00:12:29,053 --> 00:12:30,223
He doesn't recognize me...

209
00:12:30,503 --> 00:12:32,023
I'm sorry, due to our mistake,

210
00:12:32,343 --> 00:12:34,103
we caused you trouble and inconvenience.

211
00:12:34,173 --> 00:12:35,693
If you ever need anything, feel free to tell me.

212
00:12:35,893 --> 00:12:36,533
Also,

213
00:12:36,743 --> 00:12:38,743
all of your consumption tonight

214
00:12:38,743 --> 00:12:39,533
is on the house.

215
00:12:40,463 --> 00:12:42,023
I hope it doesn't ruin your good mood.

216
00:12:42,503 --> 00:12:43,893
Looks like he really doesn't recognize me.

217
00:12:43,933 --> 00:12:45,383
No need, it's okay.

218
00:12:45,813 --> 00:12:46,693
Then I'll take my leave.

219
00:12:47,383 --> 00:12:48,023
Sang...

220
00:12:53,503 --> 00:12:54,813
Well, I should pretend not to know him.

221
00:12:55,863 --> 00:12:56,693
The Headliner...

222
00:12:57,933 --> 00:12:58,813
Your coat.

223
00:13:00,343 --> 00:13:01,413
Sang...

224
00:13:02,173 --> 00:13:03,293
The Headliner?

225
00:13:07,173 --> 00:13:07,743
Sorry,

226
00:13:08,573 --> 00:13:10,463
we are a proper restaurant bar here.

227
00:13:11,773 --> 00:13:12,983
That's quite a shame.

228
00:13:14,383 --> 00:13:16,293
Aren't you happy wearing my clothes?

229
00:13:16,813 --> 00:13:18,413
Seems like I'm more famous than Overtime.

230
00:13:19,343 --> 00:13:20,623
Take it as a souvenir.

231
00:13:36,693 --> 00:13:37,293
You're back.

232
00:13:40,383 --> 00:13:42,463
I just met the boss in the restroom.

233
00:13:42,693 --> 00:13:43,343
He said...

234
00:13:45,423 --> 00:13:47,043
He really said that?

235
00:13:48,503 --> 00:13:49,603
Why didn't he advise you

236
00:13:49,603 --> 00:13:51,233
to frame it at your house?

237
00:13:51,863 --> 00:13:53,023
That's exactly what he meant.

238
00:13:54,573 --> 00:13:56,103
But don't mind what he said.

239
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:57,173
Handsome, we need to order.

240
00:13:57,173 --> 00:13:58,293
After all, he's the star attraction here.

241
00:13:58,693 --> 00:13:59,503
Let me take a good look at him.

242
00:13:59,813 --> 00:14:02,243
- Really? - Of course.

243
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:04,143
Handsome, we need to order here.

244
00:14:04,863 --> 00:14:05,533
What do you need?

245
00:14:05,663 --> 00:14:06,693
Alright.

246
00:14:06,693 --> 00:14:08,103
Why is there someone next to him?

247
00:14:08,503 --> 00:14:09,463
He's got such good luck with ladies.

248
00:14:12,743 --> 00:14:14,383
Hello, here's your drink.

249
00:14:14,383 --> 00:14:15,813
And here's your refund.

250
00:14:16,103 --> 00:14:16,933
What's this about?

251
00:14:17,743 --> 00:14:19,743
Sorry, it was my mistake earlier.

252
00:14:19,743 --> 00:14:21,053
The boss said

253
00:14:21,103 --> 00:14:22,223
that this table's on the house.

254
00:14:22,503 --> 00:14:23,573
It's not that serious.

255
00:14:23,623 --> 00:14:24,623
Take the money back.

256
00:14:24,743 --> 00:14:25,263
It's okay.

257
00:14:25,263 --> 00:14:26,813
It's common for men to buy drinks for pretty ladies.

258
00:14:28,173 --> 00:14:28,893
Thank you.

259
00:14:36,653 --> 00:14:37,343
Where's the boss?

260
00:14:41,653 --> 00:14:42,503
Give me a drink.

261
00:14:58,743 --> 00:14:59,293
She didn't accept it?

262
00:15:00,023 --> 00:15:00,933
Sir,

263
00:15:01,413 --> 00:15:03,173
this might not be the money for the drink.

264
00:15:03,573 --> 00:15:05,863
I just heard those two customers saying...

265
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,103
You've forgotten why you came here?

266
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:09,983
How could a simple "look"

267
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,173
do justice to his elegance?

268
00:15:14,933 --> 00:15:17,383
This could be something for you...

269
00:15:18,463 --> 00:15:19,173
What thing?

270
00:15:19,933 --> 00:15:20,653
A tip.

271
00:15:23,773 --> 00:15:24,933
Sir, are you accepting it?

272
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:27,863
I'll go get busy now.

273
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:30,223
Sir,

274
00:15:30,383 --> 00:15:31,263
what's going on?

275
00:15:31,893 --> 00:15:33,413
Our bar's not that desperate yet, are we?

276
00:15:33,623 --> 00:15:35,173
You're really going the extra mile.

277
00:15:57,383 --> 00:15:58,103
Yifan,

278
00:15:58,263 --> 00:15:59,393
how's the house I found for you?

279
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:00,463
Are you settling in alright?

280
00:16:01,053 --> 00:16:03,223
Although the environment isn't that great,

281
00:16:03,223 --> 00:16:05,263
at least it's convenient for transportation.

282
00:16:05,263 --> 00:16:06,933
This should make your commute a bit easier.

283
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,263
If I hadn't chosen to separate from him

284
00:16:10,573 --> 00:16:12,173
back in high school,

285
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,893
what would I be like now?

286
00:16:17,263 --> 00:16:18,623
Would I be happier than now?

287
00:16:19,293 --> 00:16:20,693
And braver?

288
00:16:22,743 --> 00:16:24,053
In this world,

289
00:16:24,653 --> 00:16:26,223
is there really another me?

290
00:16:29,813 --> 00:16:31,343
In a parallel universe,

291
00:16:32,463 --> 00:16:34,813
she might walk a completely different path than mine.

292
00:16:37,143 --> 00:16:38,693
If we met at this moment,

293
00:16:40,503 --> 00:16:41,383
I wonder

294
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,503
how would the other me see me?

295
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:11,023
Yifan,

296
00:17:12,183 --> 00:17:13,773
are you listening?

297
00:17:14,983 --> 00:17:15,743
What did you say?

298
00:17:16,183 --> 00:17:17,813
I said, are you settling in alright

299
00:17:17,813 --> 00:17:18,983
in the house I found for you?

300
00:17:21,023 --> 00:17:21,813
It's fine, I guess.

301
00:17:22,903 --> 00:17:23,703
Then that's good.

302
00:17:25,903 --> 00:17:26,983
I've arrived at the station.

303
00:17:27,183 --> 00:17:28,983
Be safe and text me when you get back.

304
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:29,613
- Alright. - Bye.

305
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:30,423

can you stop acting like this all the time?

329
00:19:19,983 --> 00:19:21,053
you threw your clothes in there too.

330
00:19:21,053 --> 00:19:21,943
Isn't that disgusting?

331
00:19:22,093 --> 00:19:23,293
What about the risk of infection?

332
00:19:23,293 --> 00:19:24,463

Lady,

what would you like to drink?

345
00:20:11,943 --> 00:20:13,703
When we came here for dinner last night,

346
00:20:13,703 --> 00:20:14,533
We dropped a bracelet.

347
00:20:14,703 --> 00:20:15,463
Did anyone find it?

348
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,103
Bracelet?

349
00:20:19,903 --> 00:20:20,773
Last night,

350
00:20:21,323 --> 00:20:22,483
which table were you sitting at?

351
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,093
That one.

352
00:20:24,743 --> 00:20:25,423
The first table.

353
00:20:25,533 --> 00:20:26,663
These past two days,

354
00:20:26,663 --> 00:20:28,023
I've been checking lost items.

355
00:20:28,023 --> 00:20:29,223
I really haven't seen a bracelet.

356
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:30,293
Zhuo,

357
00:20:30,503 --> 00:20:31,223
come over here.

358
00:20:31,573 --> 00:20:33,263
This lady was sitting at that table last night.

359
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:34,663
Did you see a bracelet dropped there?

360
00:20:36,813 --> 00:20:38,223
I accidentally bumped into you that day.

361
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,093
Sorry.

362
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,573
Mr. Yan cleaned the place last night.

363
00:20:40,813 --> 00:20:42,593
When he took the clothes,

364
00:20:42,593 --> 00:20:44,223
he probably took the bracelet, too.

365
00:20:47,293 --> 00:20:47,983
It's okay.

366
00:20:47,983 --> 00:20:49,293
I'll leave my contact information.

367
00:20:49,593 --> 00:20:50,343
Okay.

368
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:51,663
[Overtime]

369
00:20:51,663 --> 00:20:53,333
You can write it down here.

370
00:20:58,053 --> 00:20:59,223
I'm the bartender here.

371
00:20:59,223 --> 00:20:59,853
My name's He Mingbo.

372
00:21:00,263 --> 00:21:01,573
If there are any further questions,

373
00:21:01,573 --> 00:21:02,613
you can contact me anytime.

374
00:21:02,743 --> 00:21:03,983

Are you sure I didn't install a camera?

564
00:30:32,023 --> 00:30:32,943
how did you change the minds

565
00:30:32,943 --> 00:30:34,133
of the couple running an illegal business?

566
00:30:35,373 --> 00:30:36,463
Well...

567
00:30:36,463 --> 00:30:38,503
At that moment, maybe it was another version of me

568
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,943
who acted that bravely.

569
00:30:40,183 --> 00:30:41,663
Most of the time,

570
00:30:42,183 --> 00:30:43,983
I didn't know where she was hiding.

571
00:30:44,373 --> 00:30:45,703
It was just a gut reaction.

572
00:30:45,983 --> 00:30:47,773
They were eventually moved by you

573
00:30:47,773 --> 00:30:49,533
and turned themselves in.

574
00:30:49,533 --> 00:30:50,573
It was instinct?

00:30:52,503 --> 00:30:54,703

just a natural reaction.

This is the vibe New Year's Eve should have.

00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,223
I heard a lot of people are confessing today.

You can't say it like that.

Just because I haven't met someone new

620
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:34,053
doesn't mean I won't meet an old love.

621

What's going on?

752
00:38:54,093 --> 00:38:54,733
Yifan,

753
00:38:55,093 --> 00:38:56,383
if you had come later,

754
00:38:56,613 --> 00:38:57,573
you'd only see

755
00:38:57,573 --> 00:38:58,823
my frozen dead body.

756
00:39:00,983 --> 00:39:01,883
Well, thanks then.

757
00:39:01,883 --> 00:39:02,983
I'm actually short on topics.

758
00:39:03,343 --> 00:39:04,603
It's so cold.

759
00:39:07,533 --> 00:39:08,303
Warm up your hands.

760
00:39:09,733 --> 00:39:10,573
Thanks, Yifan.

761
00:39:13,693 --> 00:39:15,423
Let's interview some street performers later.

762
00:39:15,423 --> 00:39:16,213
Okay, sure.

763
00:39:17,133 --> 00:39:18,613
Our reporters are currently at True Love Square,

764
00:39:18,613 --> 00:39:20,173
where the New Year's Eve fireworks

765
00:39:20,173 --> 00:39:21,093
will be held.

766
00:39:21,093 --> 00:39:23,053
It's getting closer to midnight.

767
00:39:23,053 --> 00:39:24,863
The place is already packed with people.

768
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,503
Everyone's looking forward to the new year's arrival.

769
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:28,213
Today, we're lucky to interview

770
00:39:28,213 --> 00:39:29,463
the director of Youguang Drama.

771
00:39:29,463 --> 00:39:30,613
Can you explain

772
00:39:30,613 --> 00:39:32,093
the meaning of this creation?

773
00:39:32,823 --> 00:39:34,093
What's your New Year's wish?

774
00:39:34,093 --> 00:39:35,093
Not failing my exams!

775
00:39:35,863 --> 00:39:37,573
I hope my deskmate becomes my girlfriend!

776
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:39,093
You just said it to the camera?

777
00:39:39,093 --> 00:39:40,503
Aren't you afraid your parents will see?

778
00:39:40,733 --> 00:39:41,463
Miss,

779
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:42,983
can I redo this one?

780
00:39:43,053 --> 00:39:44,303
New Year's almost here.

781
00:39:44,303 --> 00:39:45,823
Can you tell us your New Year's wish?

782
00:39:47,053 --> 00:39:49,573
Can you play fewer games and spend more time with me?

783
00:39:50,173 --> 00:39:51,823
What kind of New Year's wish is that?

784
00:39:55,173 --> 00:39:56,253
Fu Zhuang, did you hear that?

785
00:39:57,343 --> 00:39:58,783
The countdown's about to begin.

786
00:39:58,783 --> 00:40:00,573
Get ready to capture some close-up shots of the fireworks.

787
00:40:00,733 --> 00:40:01,783
Alright, thanks to both of you.

788
00:40:01,783 --> 00:40:03,783
